# V6 DX-Final: dev-init — prepare the host-side bind-mount targets so
# Docker doesn't create them as root (the classic "permission denied"
# footgun on fresh clones). Also pre-creates webpent.db so the SQLite
# WAL/SHM sidecar files don't end up root-owned.
#
# V8 FIX: webpent.db ownership hand-off. On the FIRST `make dev-up`,
# entrypoint.sh (running as root inside the container) chowns the
# bind-mounted db files to the container's webpent UID. On SUBSEQUENT
# `make dev-up` runs, those files are owned by the container UID, not
# the host user — so an unconditional `touch` (which updates the
# timestamp) fails with "Permission denied". Fix: only touch/chmod
# each db file IF it does not already exist. If it exists (regardless
# of owner), leave it alone — the container already owns it and will
# read/write it fine. Do NOT add sudo; do NOT change entrypoint.sh.
dev-init:
	@echo "Initializing dev workspace (memory/ output/ webpent.db)..."
	@mkdir -p memory memory/global output
	@# V8 FIX: touch + chmod ONLY if the file does not already exist.
	@# After the first container start, entrypoint.sh chowns these to
	@# the container's webpent UID — a host-side touch on an
	@# existing file owned by another UID fails with Permission denied.
	@[ -f webpent.db ] || { touch webpent.db && chmod 644 webpent.db; }
	@[ -f webpent.db-wal ] || { touch webpent.db-wal && chmod 644 webpent.db-wal; }
	@[ -f webpent.db-shm ] || { touch webpent.db-shm && chmod 644 webpent.db-shm; }
	@echo "Done. You can now run 'make dev-up'."

dev-up:
	@echo "Ensuring dev workspace exists..."
	@mkdir -p memory memory/global output
	@# V8 FIX: same ownership hand-off logic as dev-init — only
	@# touch/chmod if the file does NOT already exist. This prevents
	@# "Permission denied" on the second `make dev-up` after
	@# entrypoint.sh has chowned the db files to the container UID.
	@[ -f webpent.db ] || { touch webpent.db && chmod 644 webpent.db; }
	@[ -f webpent.db-wal ] || { touch webpent.db-wal && chmod 644 webpent.db-wal; }
	@[ -f webpent.db-shm ] || { touch webpent.db-shm && chmod 644 webpent.db-shm; }
	@# V7 Phase 2 FIX: bring down any existing stack for this exact
	@# compose file (including orphans) so leftover containers/networks
	@# from a previous invocation never linger and cause "name already
	@# taken" conflicts. container_name is intentionally hardcoded in
	@# docker-compose.dev.yml (other targets rely on the fixed names:
	@# `make doctor` greps `webpent-dev-api`, the worker healthcheck
	@# comment references it, operators run `docker logs webpent-dev-api`).
	@# The lifecycle discipline belongs here, not in dropping the names.
	@docker-compose -f $(DEV_COMPOSE) down --remove-orphans >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
	docker-compose -f $(DEV_COMPOSE) up -d --build
	@# V7 Phase 3 FIX: poll /health before reporting success. docker-proxy
	@# accepts and resets connections during the window between "container
	@# running" and "uvicorn bound to port 8000", which previously surfaced
	@# as a confusing "Connection reset by peer" against a healthy stack.
	@# Curl -sf retries every 1s, capped at 30 attempts; on timeout, point
	@# the operator at `docker logs webpent-dev-api` instead of falsely
	@# reporting success. The container's own HEALTHCHECK (start-period=10s,
	@# retries=3) tracks the same transition in parallel for `docker ps`.

# --remove-orphans` can't untangle (e.g. orphaned containers from a
# renamed/duplicated project folder — see Phase 0 of the v7 fix plan).

# directly. Safe because the names are hardcoded and bounded.
