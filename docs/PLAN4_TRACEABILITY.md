## Phase notes

### P0 — Reproducible baseline and repository recovery (PARTIAL)

- WebPent and bbscout final combined rerun is represented separately in release evidence.
- No generated runtime database, cache, credential, cookie, or private key is evidence for a release.

### P1 — Repository boundary and provider-neutral contracts (PASS)

- The provider source is an external integration tree and is not claimed as committed to WebPent Git.
- Fixture contracts are offline and provider-neutral; they are not official live schema validation.

### P2 — Multi-provider discovery and safe credential handling (PARTIAL)

- Offline fixture smoke is complete for HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and YesWeHack.
- Provider live smoke is NOT RUN: no separate provider authorization was supplied.
- Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and YesWeHack remain fixture-only; no live support is claimed.

### P3 — Program selection by expected confirmed-finding yield (PASS)

- No bounty size, brand popularity, or domain count is treated as confirmation evidence.

### P4 — Scope normalization, package signing, and admission (PASS)

- Private signing keys are runtime-only and are not packaged or persisted by the CLI path.

### P5 — Complete WebPent wiring (PASS)

- Evidence is dry-run/mock based; no live target was contacted.

### P6 — Target understanding and complex-target modeling (PASS)

- The evidence is offline fixture and mock-transport evidence, not WAPTLab qualification.

### P7 — Identity, browser, mailbox, and workflow capability (PARTIAL)

- Offline contracts and secret guards are tested.
- No authorized mailbox/browser credential workflow was executed in this run.

### P8 — Unified execution plane and distributed safety (PASS)

- G-02 is evaluated from generated inventory and runtime/precommit checks, not from a manual assertion.

### P9 — Validator and oracle expansion (PASS)

- No finding is promoted from URL names, status codes, response text, or LLM confidence alone.

### P10 — Autonomous research loop (PASS)

- This proves bounded offline controller behavior, not autonomous live exploitation.

### P11 — Proof, reporting, and evidence integrity (PASS)

- Proof claims here are from offline/mocked validation paths only.

### P12 — WAPTLab qualification and complex-target optimization (NOT QUALIFIED)

- NOT RUN: no authorized local WAPTLab instance, target package, or separate qualification authorization was provided.
- No live target/provider I/O was performed and no VIP claim is made.

### P13 — Production hardening and release packaging (PARTIAL)

- Final combined gate and clean integration archive are generated after this report is created.
- Release decision must remain blocked until all required evidence and authorized qualification exist.

## Safety boundary

| Item | Recorded state |
| --- | --- |
| Live provider I/O | `NOT RUN` |
| Live target I/O | `NOT RUN` |
| WAPTLab qualification | `NOT QUALIFIED` |
| Automatic disclosure/submission | `DISABLED` |
