# ADI v1 — Completion Report

**Project:** WebPent / Autonomous Discovery Intelligence (ADI)  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Scope:** bounded, deterministic, advisory research intelligence over existing ASROS/AVDE contracts  
**Execution mode:** offline replay of recorded controlled evidence; no new network campaign was run

## Executive statement

ADI v1 has been implemented as an additive intelligence layer over ASROS and AVDE. The implementation adds historical evidence context, scoped failure learning, dynamic research-map prioritization, research decision records, multi-step chain contracts, and advisory confidence review. It does not create Findings, perform transport, create a second authority layer, override policy, replace causal oracles, or promote hypotheses into confirmed vulnerabilities [1](../../src/webpent/adi/intelligence.py) [2](../../src/webpent/avde/pipeline.py).

The engineering implementation and regression work are complete within the bounded scope. **Detection-quality qualification is not established.** The controlled artifact contains one scorable recorded case mapped to Broken Access Control and three blocked cases. The three ADI multi-step chains remain blocked because the recorded evidence does not contain complete candidate/control causal chains and ground-truth-backed proof. No production precision/recall, real-world detection rate, P10, P9, or VIP claim is made [3](../../reports/evaluation/adi/ADI_CONTROLLED_BENCHMARK_v1.json).

## Phase completion matrix

| 3 | Research Decision Record and reasoning layer | Complete | Deterministic `ResearchDecisionRecord` with alternatives, information gain, cost, risk, and evidence lineage [1](../../src/webpent/adi/intelligence.py) |
| 4 | Dynamic Research Map and adaptive prioritization | Complete | Scoped, deterministic map using invariant, surface signal, history, and failure context [1](../../src/webpent/adi/intelligence.py) |
| 5 | Failure Intelligence and invariant expansion | Complete | Deduplicated scoped failure memory and contrast-required invariant mining [1](../../src/webpent/adi/intelligence.py) [5](../../src/webpent/avde/behavior.py) |

| 7 | Controlled multi-step benchmark and efficiency metrics | Complete | Offline runner and artifact; zero requests by the runner, no synthetic observations or ProofBundles [3](../../reports/evaluation/adi/ADI_CONTROLLED_BENCHMARK_v1.json) [7](../../scripts/run_avde_controlled_benchmark.py) |
| 8 | Regression suite and quality gates | Complete with documented historical exceptions | 17 focused ADI/AVDE tests passed; scoped Ruff, compileall, neutrality, secret, direct-I/O, G-02, and diff checks passed. Full suite: 2112 passed and 7 pre-existing historical failures. |
| 9 | Completion report, release manifest, and provenance | Complete for source release | Release workflow is maintained separately from this report; manifest/provenance must be regenerated after the final source commit. |
| 10 | Delivery ZIP and governing assessment | Pending final packaging | ZIP is created only after the final source, manifest, provenance, and verification commits are complete. |

## Implemented components

The ADI package is exposed through a narrow public surface containing advisory contracts and the `ADIIntelligenceEngine`. The package deliberately excludes transport, ActionAuthority, CampaignExecutor, Finding creation, oracle override, policy override, and human-signoff capabilities [8](../../src/webpent/adi/__init__.py).

The principal contracts are `HistoricalEvidence`, `FailureMemoryRecord`, `ResearchDecisionRecord`, `ResearchSurfaceSignal`, `DynamicResearchNode`, `DynamicResearchMap`, and `ResearchConfidenceReport`. All are strict Pydantic models with bounded fields, deterministic identifiers where applicable, immutable configuration, and explicit advisory boundary flags [1](../../src/webpent/adi/intelligence.py).

The engine supports deterministic map rebuilding, scope isolation by engagement and target, failure deduplication, decision generation from existing AVDE hypotheses and validation plans, and confidence review. It accepts surface signals but does not execute them. Any execution remains delegated to the existing central routing and authority layers.

## Controlled benchmark result

The benchmark is an offline replay of the previously recorded ASROS controlled artifact. It is not a new campaign and it does not create missing evidence. The runner sent zero requests, used no credentials, performed no state mutation, and created no synthetic observations or ProofBundles [3](../../reports/evaluation/adi/ADI_CONTROLLED_BENCHMARK_v1.json).

| Metric or disposition | Recorded result | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| Registered vulnerability classes | 6 | Inventory size only; not six measured classes |
| Scorable cases | 1 | One recorded IDOR case mapped to Broken Access Control |
| Scorable classes | 1 | Broken Access Control only |
| Blocked cases | 3 | Excluded from TP/FN/clean and not treated as detection failures |
| ADI chains registered | 3 | IDOR, privilege-boundary, and business-workflow chains |
| ADI chains scorable | 0 | Complete multi-step chain evidence is unavailable in the source artifact |
| Duplicate-investigation reduction | 1.0 | Internal replay-derived indicator only |
| Evidence completeness | 1.0 | Completeness of the represented recorded case, not system-wide quality |
| Validation efficiency | 0.3333333333 | Internal recorded-research indicator; not production efficiency |
| Production precision/recall | Not calculated | Ground truth and causal coverage are insufficient |
| Real-world detection rate | Not measured | No compliant real-world campaign was run |

The artifact reports a raw scorable-class value of `idor` for source compatibility and a canonical class value of `broken_access_control`; it does not treat IDOR as a separate vulnerability class [3](../../reports/evaluation/adi/ADI_CONTROLLED_BENCHMARK_v1.json).

## Verification results

| Gate | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Focused ADI/AVDE regression | Passed | `17 passed` in the final gate run |
| Scoped Ruff lint | Passed | ADI, AVDE, benchmark, runner, and tests |
| Scoped Ruff format check | Passed | Same changed scope |
| Compileall | Passed | ADI, AVDE, benchmark, and runner scope |
| Generic target neutrality | Passed | No target-specific hardcoding introduced in generic ADI layer |
| Secret scan | Passed | No tracked secret detected in changed scope |
| Direct-I/O scan | Passed | Correct invocation used `PYTHONPATH=src`; inventory contains 353 records |
| G-02 | Passed | No external target contact; no new direct transport in ADI |
| `git diff --check` | Passed | No whitespace errors |
| Full pytest | 2112 passed / 7 failed | The seven failures are the previously documented historical failures: four approval-source-hash mismatches and three absent local source fixtures for WebGoat, crAPI, and Juice Shop. No ADI regression was identified. |

The first direct-I/O invocation without `PYTHONPATH=src` failed with an import error. This was an invocation-environment failure, not a source finding. The corrected command passed, and G-02 passed afterward.

## Safety and governance status

ADI remains advisory and bounded. The following states are intentionally unchanged:

| Governance control | Current value |
|---|---|
| `official_isolated_p10_runs_authorized` | `false` |
| P10 | `NOT_QUALIFIED` |
| P9 | `NOT_QUALIFIED` |
| VIP | `NOT_QUALIFIED` |
| Bug Bounty | `BLOCKED` |
| Human independent signoff | `false` |
| Qualification effect | `false` |
| Real-world detection rate | `false` / not measured |

No credentials, login flows, external targets, callbacks, mutation, destructive actions, frozen ground-truth edits, threshold edits, policy edits, or official qualification runs were introduced by this ADI implementation.

## Remaining blockers and next evidence required

The main blocker is evidence availability, not missing advisory code. To establish measurable detection quality, the project would need an owner-approved controlled causal lab with safe preconditions, independent negative controls, central verification, sealed/replayable ProofBundles, and valid ground truth for additional classes. Those actions are outside this bounded offline release when they require credentials, login, mutation, new permissions, or target-runtime changes. They must not be simulated by adding cases to the benchmark artifact.

Until those prerequisites are met, the correct interpretation is **engineering-complete advisory intelligence with insufficient evidence for quality qualification**. The implementation must not be described as autonomous vulnerability detection success, P10 qualification, P9 qualification, VIP qualification, or Bug Bounty readiness.

## Delivery contents

The release package is expected to include the ADI source package, AVDE compatibility changes, regression tests, controlled benchmark contracts and runner, the recorded benchmark artifact, this completion report, design documentation, release manifest, provenance sidecar, the pasted specification, and final gate logs. Caches, temporary files, secrets, and untracked runtime debris are excluded.
