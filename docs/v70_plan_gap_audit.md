# v70 Plan Gap Audit — Follow-up Review

## Scope

This audit compares `/home/ubuntu/upload/pasted_content_2.txt` with the repository after the v62–v70 release and the follow-up gap implementation. A plan item is marked complete only when source code and focused contracts demonstrate the behavior. The audit does not claim live findings or live qualification without an authorized run artifact.

## Implemented and verified

| Plan area | Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Target Knowledge projection | `src/webpent/knowledge/target_knowledge.py`, `builder.py`, state wiring, v62 tests | Complete; typed, engagement-scoped, additive, fail-closed |
| Named knowledge facades | `knowledge/target_model.py`, `entity_graph.py`, `workflow_model.py`, `auth_model.py`, `data_flow_model.py`, v71 gap contracts | Complete; thin read-only facades over the canonical model |
| Attack Graph projection | `shared/attack_graph.py`, attack-graph agent wiring, v62 graph tests | Complete; evidence-backed and deterministic |
| Named attack-graph package | `attack_graph/builder.py`, `path_ranker.py`, `reasoner.py`, v71 gap contracts | Complete; delegates to the canonical shared builder |
| Hypothesis lifecycle | `research/*`, `HypothesisStatus.LEARNED`, v63 tests | Complete; deterministic transitions and fail-closed validation |
| Proof validation | `validators/*`, v64 tests | Complete; structural, causal, and replay contracts; no automatic promotion |
| Multi-agent boundaries | `agents/team.py`, v64 tests | Complete; roles and artifact boundaries do not grant execution authority |
| Coverage and LLM boundary | `shared/coverage_ledger.py`, `shared/copilot_boundary.py`, v65 tests | Complete; outcome-based metrics and non-authoritative suggestions |
| Named coverage package | `coverage/coverage_map.py`, `gap_detector.py`, v71 gap contracts | Complete; explicit unknown and blocked states |
| Copilot planner/critic/explainer | `copilot/*`, v71 gap contracts | Complete; proposal-only/read-only and limited to research-safe actions |
| Experience memory | `experience/store.py`, v71 gap contracts | Complete; engagement/client scoped and append-only without finding promotion |
| Persistence capability | `persistence/backend_capability.py`, v71 gap contracts | Complete as a fail-closed capability report; SQLite is supported, PostgreSQL remains unqualified |
| Celery reliability and observability | `workers/observability.py`, worker signal wiring, v71 remaining contracts | Complete as local metadata/configuration contracts; live broker/DLQ qualification remains external |
| Benchmark metrics | `benchmark/metrics.py`, v66 tests | Complete; precision, recall, FPR, evidence quality, coverage, reproducibility |
| Qualification schemas | `benchmark/qualification.py`, v71 remaining contracts | Complete as deterministic ground-truth/run schemas; no live claim |
| CLI roadmap | `coverage`, `analyze`, `campaign`, `knowledge`, `replay`, `explain` and contract tests | Complete as local read-only/planning commands; no implicit network execution |
| Release contracts | v70 tests, VIP gate, SBOM/release artifacts, v70 validation report | Complete for code and artifact contracts; dependency advisories remain a release blocker |

## Remaining external or environmental blockers

| Item | Reality | Correct treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency security gate | `pip-audit` executes and reports 17 known vulnerabilities across 9 packages | Keep the release gate non-green until dependencies are upgraded or formally risk-accepted; do not suppress advisories |
| Container scanners | Availability of tools such as Trivy, Syft, or Grype depends on the release environment | Report unavailable scanners explicitly; do not claim their results |
| PostgreSQL production qualification | The project currently supports SQLite through the canonical database manager | Keep PostgreSQL fail-closed and unqualified until a real deployment is tested |
| Live Celery broker/DLQ qualification | Local contracts exist, but no authorized broker qualification artifact is present | Keep `qualified_live_broker=false` and do not claim operational qualification |
| Three-run live lab qualification | No independently captured authorized runs proving precision, recall, reproducibility, or 15–20 confirmed findings are present in this review | Do not claim live vulnerability counts; use explicit qualification artifacts when available |

## Verification snapshot

The follow-up contracts pass in isolation and the full suite passes with **916 tests**. `compileall` and Ruff pass with zero errors under the project command. The implementation remains additive and no WAPTLab or Juice Shop source is modified by these changes.

The project is therefore complete with respect to the implementable v62–v70 software contracts. The remaining items are deployment, dependency, or authorized live-qualification gates rather than forgotten source modules.
