# WebPent v60 VIP Audit Compliance Matrix

**Source of truth:** `/home/ubuntu/upload/التدقيقالشاملالنهائيلـWebPentوتحويلهإلىVIPAutonomousBugHunter.md`

**Review rule:** لا يُعتبر وجود enum أو helper دليلًا على دعم فعلي. الحالة `implemented` تحتاج implementation واختبارًا سلوكيًا. أي فئة لم تُجرَ عليها عملية discovery/execution/oracle/evidence كاملة تبقى `partial` أو `missing-validator` أو `not_observed`، ولا تُعرض كـconfirmed finding.

| ID | Audit requirement | Current status | Evidence in this release | Remaining limitation or follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WEB-PROD-01 | auth enabled/default، auth-off token guard، public bind fail-closed | implemented | `api/auth.py`, `shared/preflight.py`, `tests/test_vip_auth_posture.py` | Re-run in the target deployment environment before production rollout |
| WEB-PROD-02 | global admin مقابل tenant admin وresource ownership | implemented | `api/auth.py`, `api/app.py`, `tests/test_v63_vip_security_regression.py` | None known in the tested contract |
| WEB-PROD-03 | shared token revocation across workers | implemented | `memory/db.py`, `api/auth.py`, VIP revocation regressions | Requires shared production SQLite/storage availability |
| WEB-PROD-04 | encrypted reauth vault، resume/cross-worker lifecycle، terminal cleanup | implemented | `auth/reauth_vault.py`, `memory/db.py`, Alembic 0003، worker sweep hooks، task crypto، shared-vault regressions | Shared SQLite persistence is opt-in via `WEBPENT_REAUTH_VAULT_SHARED_STORE=true`; API/workers must share the database and `CELERY_PAYLOAD_KEY`; default remains backward-compatible in-memory fallback |
| WEB-PROD-05 | signed resume، atomic consume-once، lease، redelivery idempotency | implemented | `api/scan_registry.py`, app/worker regressions | None known in the tested contract |
| WEB-PROD-06 | registry failure operator-visible and fail-safe | implemented | registry readiness/error state، `/health` degraded status، gap regression | None known in the tested contract |
| WEB-PROD-07 | login-specific per-IP/account throttling | implemented | login IP/account buckets، generic 429، Redis fail-closed tests | Trusted proxy configuration must be correct in production |
| WEB-PROD-08 | transactional Playwright HTTP/WebSocket guard | implemented | `shared/http.py`, transactional registration and Playwright regressions | None known in the tested contract |
| WEB-PROD-09 | unified exact OriginPolicy across transports | implemented | `shared/engagement_scope.py`, HTTP/redirect/Playwright/WS gates، OriginPolicy regressions | Raw-socket/OOB callers must keep engagement scope context active |
| WEB-PROD-10 | raw socket total deadline، idle/bytes/connection budgets | implemented | monotonic deadline and bounded request/response handling in request-smuggling agent، regression tests | End-to-end desync confirmation still requires an authorized target and controlled oracle |
| WEB-PROD-11 | parser rejection separated from desync confirmation | implemented/verify | explicit `confirmed`/`parser_rejected`/`inconclusive` outcome taxonomy and conservative promotion | Live differential proxy oracle is environment-dependent |
| WEB-PROD-12 | central executable allowlist/manifest | implemented | `tools/utils/subprocess.py` canonical manifest and rejection regression | Custom production tools must be explicitly registered |
| WEB-PROD-13 | structured deserialization flag validation | implemented | `shared/deserialization.py` structured allowlist/denylist and behavioral tests | No claim is made for unsupported tool syntaxes |
| WEB-PROD-14 | opaque secret references in state | implemented/verify | `state/initial_state.py`, `secret_refs`, worker/CLI sealing, checkpoint tests | Legacy callers may still pass empty compatibility fields; plaintext secrets are scrubbed at persistence boundary |
| WEB-PROD-15 | deny-by-default secret redaction | implemented | recursive state and metadata redaction plus api-key/totp/nested-key regressions | New secret-shaped fields should be added to the regression corpus when introduced |
| WEB-PROD-16 | periodic/bounded vault sweep and terminal cleanup | implemented/verify | bounded `sweep_expired`/stats and worker lifecycle hooks | Process shutdown hooks remain deployment-process dependent |
| WEB-QUAL-01 | dependency upgrades or explicit non-silent blocker | blocked, documented | `pip-audit-production.json`, strict CI audit, release notes | LangChain/LangGraph major upgrade currently conflicts with the resolver and was intentionally not forced |
| WEB-QUAL-02 | CI/local environment contract | implemented | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, deployment contract tests، deterministic offline flags | CI still needs its own external run for provider-specific behavior |
| WEB-QUAL-03 | release-scoped Ruff zero | implemented | Ruff passed on all files modified in this remediation | None known |
| WEB-QUAL-04 | broad exception classification/events | partial | critical security paths classify/restrict failures; registry and request paths are fail-closed | Historical non-critical broad catches remain and need a separate low-risk refactor |
| WEB-QUAL-05 | behavioral tests instead of source inspection | partial | New gap, deployment, campaign, and security tests are behavioral | Historical source-inspection tests remain for legacy contracts |
| WEB-QUAL-06 | worker critical-path coverage >=85% | blocked/partial | Full suite: `576 passed`; measured worker module coverage: **23%** | Reaching 85% requires a dedicated Celery/graph integration harness; the release does not misrepresent this gap |
| WEB-QUAL-07 | security helpers wired or explicitly NOT_WIRED | implemented/verify | SQLMap flag filter and safe RCE command allowlist are now enforced at live collector call sites | Unsupported future helpers must be marked `NOT_WIRED` before use |
| WEB-QUAL-08 | validator plugin registry/contracts | implemented/verify | `agents/validator/registry.py`, deterministic capability matrix, seven-stage plugin contracts, and `shared/offline_validator_fixtures.py` with local evidence/oracle/cleanup adapters for the seven unsupported campaigns | Offline adapters are review-only and network-free; live executor/oracle reachability remains missing-validator until an authorized runtime path supplies real evidence |
| WEB-QUAL-09 | Docker privilege-drop UID/filesystem test | implemented | `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, compose and deployment contract tests | Runtime image execution should be smoke-tested in the production registry |
| WEB-QUAL-10 | stale security comments/docs | partial | Contradictory SQLMap helper comment removed; compliance matrix and CI docs updated | Historical comments outside touched paths remain for a later documentation sweep |
| Coverage | no fixed top-N، status ledger | implemented | strategist/crawler no longer apply fixed top-5; `coverage_ledger` records tested/missing-validator/blocked/not-observed | None known in the tested contract |
| WAPTLab campaign matrix | 20-class application-aware campaigns | partial, fail-closed | `shared/campaigns.py`, `scripts/run_waptlab_regression.py`, `docs/waptlab_regression.json`, and local regression tests cover all 20 dispositions plus four synthetic gap-driven replanning cases | Campaign inventory is not a claim that all 20 classes were confirmed. Current local report is 13 `inconclusive` and 7 `missing-validator`; no target was contacted |

## Quality evidence

The current release gates were executed locally as follows:

- **Full pytest:** `576 passed, 66 warnings`.
- **Preserved test-function count:** `537`, with CI minimum set to `498` because the verifier counts functions rather than parametrized cases.
- **Ruff:** passed on all files modified in Phases 3–7.
- **Local WAPTLab regression:** 20/20 campaign dispositions recorded; 13 `inconclusive`, 7 `missing-validator`, zero target contact, and zero WAPTLab modifications. The seven missing classes now also have offline evidence-contract adapters, but none can produce a live `tested` or confirmed status.
- **Proof Engine regression:** 14 focused tests passed, including evidence-gap replanning, duplicate suppression, scope/approval gates, causal evidence, cleanup, and confidence transitions.
- **Worker coverage:** `23%` on the full suite; this remains an explicit partial/blocked item rather than a hidden failure.

## Conservative release interpretation

This matrix is intentionally honest. The release closes the implementable P0/P1 security contracts and adds evidence for the application-aware campaign inventory, but it does not claim that unsupported validators, unobserved WAPTLab classes, dependency advisories, or worker integration coverage are complete. A production operator must configure strong `AUDIT_SECRET_KEY` and `CELERY_PAYLOAD_KEY`, use TLS Redis, and run an authorized deployment smoke test before exposure.
