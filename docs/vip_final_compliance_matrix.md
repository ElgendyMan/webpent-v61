# WebPent VIP Smart Autonomous Bug Hunter — Compliance Matrix

## Scope of this review

This review compares the supplied VIP plan with the current WebPent working tree based on commit `4b3e069c8d3c4e1bdbce92184e2bf53c74208c90` plus the uncommitted Nettacker adapter and integration-matrix changes being verified in this loop. The review and all verification commands are local only. No WAPTLab or other target was started, contacted, or modified during this review.

A capability is marked **implemented and locally evidenced** only when the source contains the contract and the local test/audit suite exercises the relevant behavior. A source module, feature flag, or README statement is not treated as runtime proof by itself. Live qualification, precision, reproducibility, and benchmark claims remain blocked when they require target execution.

## Gate matrix

| Plan gate | Current state | Evidence and interpretation | Required residual or next action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gate 0: isolated archive and source-to-runtime inventory | Implemented and locally evidenced | Review workspace `/tmp/webpent_vip_final_review_20260820` contains archive hash, source revision, runtime versions, file inventory, symbol inventory, capability mentions, execution inventory, and line-level capability evidence. The locked dependency audit is captured under `quality/pip_audit_locked_final.txt`. | Docker image digests and Docker runtime qualification remain unavailable because this loop forbids build/target execution. |
| Gate 0: no-duplication matrix | Implemented as documentation; runtime proof partial | Native ActionAuthority, ActionExecutor, ActionLedger, ProofBundle, CoverageLedger, SurfaceEvidenceGraph, GoalTree, KnowledgeGapEngine, NBA, SelfCritique, workflow and application-intent models were located before adding adapters. | Continue source-to-runtime wiring review for each capability; do not add duplicate controllers or stores. |
| Gate 1: source/license/privacy/threat-model audit | Partially implemented | AutoPentestX source was pinned and audited in the prior audit reports. Its exploit/orchestrator/report-authority paths were excluded. The current matrix records the WebPent-native boundary. | The full multi-project license/dependency audit for every project named in the plan is not complete in this no-target phase. Any unreviewed project remains rejected for distribution. |
| Gate 2: one WebPent execution plane | Implemented and locally evidenced for the existing contracts | `ActionRequest`, `ActionAuthority`, `ActionExecutor`, capability manifests, ledger reservation, idempotency, ProofBundle custody, redaction, and fail-closed states are present and covered by local tests. `verify_all.py` and AST guards pass. | A full source scan of every agent/tool wrapper must remain part of release CI; live process-group and browser qualification are not asserted here. |
| Gate 3: smart reasoning/autonomy | Partially implemented and locally evidenced | GoalTree, KnowledgeGapEngine, NextBestActionEngine, SelfCritique, structured LLM contracts/cache, hypothesis analysis, and autonomous controller exist. LLM authority remains bounded by deterministic policy. | A measurable live reduction in redundant actions or increase in useful confirmed coverage cannot be established without benchmark runs. |
| Gate 4: lifecycle/recovery | Partially implemented and locally evidenced | Capability registry, lazy discovery, task states, action ledger, Celery/resume/idempotency tests, recovery-oriented campaign executor, and failure semantics exist. Stale audit checks were corrected to test lazy discovery and fail-closed migration behavior. | Broker redelivery, worker restart, and rollback qualification need dedicated local fault-injection runs if not already covered by the existing tests. |
| Gate 5: Nettacker adapter | Implemented and locally evidenced as import-only | `src/webpent/shared/nettacker_adapter.py` accepts bounded captured JSON-compatible output, performs redaction and malformed/partial handling, binds provenance/action-ledger context, and projects same-origin surfaces as `needs_validator`; `tests/test_nettacker_adapter.py` covers normalization, limits, authority, graph, manifest, and AST no-I/O behavior. | It is intentionally not a Nettacker executor and has no live benchmark value until an approved ActionExecutor path and target-backed ablation are completed. |
| Gate 5: AutoPentestX adapter | Implemented and locally evidenced as import-only | The adapter normalizes bounded pre-existing records into WebPent observations, applies redaction and same-origin checks, carries provenance/action-ledger context, and never executes subprocess/HTTP/DNS/exploit code. | It is intentionally not a live scanner and has no benchmark value until an approved adapter execution path is built and tested through ActionExecutor. |
| Gate 6: browser/authenticated workflow | Partially implemented | Browser and workflow models, authentication, CSRF/session handling, workflow replay, and browser wrappers exist in the source and local tests. | Browser/Chromium, OTP, stored-XSS retrieval, OOB, and authenticated multi-identity qualification require local target execution and are not claimed here. |
| Gate 6: crawling and surface discovery | Partially implemented and locally evidenced | Native crawler, HTTP discovery, Katana integration/fallback, route seeds, supplement logic, SurfaceEvidenceGraph, and coverage ledger exist. | End-to-end bounded crawling and coverage improvement require a target benchmark; WAPTLab is intentionally skipped. |
| Gate 6: API/GraphQL/POST/multipart | Partially implemented | JSON/body-bearing request context and POST/JSON fixtures exist, with API/GraphQL validators and coverage contracts present where implemented. | Schemathesis/REST-Attacker/Wapiti adapters and measurable property-based coverage are not accepted without source audit and local fixtures/benchmarks. |
| Gate 6: XSS/traffic/enrichment | Partially implemented | Validator/plugin and tool-adapter boundaries exist; enrichment is not confirmation. | Dalfox/mitmproxy/Nuclei/HTTPx/Subfinder qualification remains residual until each tool is pinned, health-checked, bounded, redacted, and benchmarked. |
| Gate 7: identity/tenant/object/workflow intelligence | Implemented in models and local contracts; live proof blocked | ApplicationIntentModel, IdentityProfile/identity handling, workflow replay, primary/foreign identity logic, object/tenant concepts, differential access-control tests, and negative evidence structures exist. | Multi-tenant object/workflow behavior must be demonstrated on an authorized resettable target before being called VIP-qualified. |
| Gate 8: validator/oracle/negative-control/ProofBundle | Implemented and locally evidenced for registered capabilities | Validator registry, proof engine/bundle models, action ledger, causal/negative-control contracts, replay tests, redaction, and strict reporter gates exist. XXE is now included in the exploitable-class promotion gate but still cannot be confirmed without validator evidence. | Full class-by-class ground-truth coverage and replay success remain unmeasured without target runs. |
| Gate 9: WAPTLab/Juice Shop ablation | Not executed by requirement | The user explicitly required no WAPTLab execution in this loop. No live benchmark or finding claim is made. | Must be run later in an isolated, resettable authorized lab for VIP qualification. |
| Gate 10: quality/security/release | Locally evidenced with explicit residuals | `pytest`: 981 passed; Ruff: 0 errors; compileall: pass; unified audit: 145 pass / 0 fail; adapter AST direct-I/O guard passes; Bandit has 0 High, 4 Medium, and 63 Low results, all Medium items triaged in `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md`; pip-audit reports no known vulnerabilities; SBOM and release-manifest artifacts already exist in `docs/`. | Signed-manifest verification, Docker/tool/browser runtime qualification, and rollback exercise remain release residuals. |
| Final VIP gates | Not satisfied and correctly not claimed | The plan requires 15/20 confirmed findings in three clean runs, precision >=90%, reproducibility >=95%, complete ProofBundles, and benchmarked external capabilities. These require live targets and are not inferable from local unit tests. | Keep release label as **not VIP-qualified** until every final gate has target-backed evidence. |

## External project decision summary

| Project family | Decision in this phase |
|---|---|
| PentestGPT | Use only bounded reasoning patterns; no unrestricted LLM authority. |
| Rekono | Do not copy GPLv3 code; retain only independently implemented lifecycle ideas. |
| Nettacker | Import-only observation adapter accepted; no executor or direct network authority. |
| AutoPentestX | Import-only observation adapter accepted; orchestrator and exploit engine rejected. |
| ZAP, Katana, Playwright/Crawlee, Schemathesis, REST-Attacker, Wapiti, Dalfox, mitmproxy, Nuclei, HTTPx, Subfinder, GraphQL utilities | Deferred or retained only where native WebPent contracts already exist; no new unbenchmarked authority was introduced. |

## Local verification snapshot

The current local verification is deterministic and target-free. The Nettacker adapter and matrix changes were included in the final local run:

- Full pytest: **991 passed, 0 failures**.
- Ruff: **0 errors**.
- `compileall`: **pass**.
- Unified `verify_all.py`: **145 pass, 0 fail** after replacing stale checks with semantic checks for the current lazy tool registry, Docker base-image usage, multiline decorators, and fail-closed Alembic behavior.
- Bandit 1.9.4: **0 High, 4 Medium, 63 Low**; all Medium items are explicitly triaged in `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md` and low items remain retained for review.
- pip-audit against the locked export: **No known vulnerabilities found**.
- No WAPTLab request, process, container, or source modification was performed in this review.

## Release judgment

The current implementation is a stronger, locally verified WebPent foundation with a single policy-controlled execution boundary and an evidence-first integration model. It is **not yet entitled to the VIP Smart Autonomous Bug Hunter release label** because the plan’s decisive claims are benchmark claims: target-backed confirmation, precision, reproducibility, external-tool value, browser/OOB qualification, and clean-run ablations. Marking those items complete without target evidence would violate the plan’s own residual-risk policy.

## Additional local security evidence

The post-fix local security checks produced the following artifacts under `/tmp/webpent_vip_final_review_20260820/quality/`:

| Check | Result | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---|
| Bandit 1.9.4 on `src/` | 0 High, 4 Medium; 63 Low findings | No critical/high Bandit result was observed. The four Medium findings are triaged in `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md`; the low findings remain retained for review because the repository contains test fixtures, deterministic examples, pseudo-random nonces in non-cryptographic paths, and broad exception patterns. They are not silently suppressed. |
| pip-audit against `docs/requirements-audit-release.txt` | No known vulnerabilities found | The lock-derived dependency audit completed successfully. |
| Full pytest | 981 passed, 0 failures | Local regression baseline preserved. |
| Ruff | Pass | No lint errors. |
| compileall | Pass | Python bytecode compilation succeeded. |
| Unified audit | 145 pass, 0 fail | Repository-level release checks passed after correcting stale/brittle audit expressions. |

The Bandit Medium and Low findings are not converted into security claims. The four Medium findings are documented in `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md`; before a production release, each Medium/Low item must be triaged as either an intentional test/example, a false positive with narrowly scoped justification, or a code hardening item. No live target was used to produce these results.
