# WebPent VIP Smart Autonomous Bug Hunter — Final Local Release Report

## Executive decision

This release is **not VIP-qualified**. It is a locally verified, evidence-aware WebPent foundation with a single policy-controlled execution boundary, bounded autonomous planning, identity/workflow evidence structures, validator and ProofBundle contracts, and selective observation-only external-tool adapters.

The VIP label is intentionally withheld because the attached plan defines target-backed acceptance gates: at least 15 of 20 confirmed vulnerabilities in three independent clean runs, precision of at least 90%, reproducibility of at least 95%, browser/OOB/body-bearing HTTP qualification, external-tool ablation value, and worker/Docker/rollback qualification. Those claims cannot be established without authorized live benchmark runs, and WAPTLab was explicitly skipped in this loop.

## Implementation status

| Area | Local status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Central execution plane | Implemented and locally verified | `ActionRequest`, `ActionAuthority`, `ActionExecutor`, capability manifests, ledger reservation, idempotency, and fail-closed policy tests |
| Proof and confirmation custody | Implemented and locally verified | Validator contracts, positive/negative evidence requirements, sealed replayable ProofBundle tests, redacted report projection |
| Autonomy and reasoning | Implemented with deterministic authority boundaries | GoalTree, KnowledgeGapEngine, NextBestActionEngine, SelfCritique, structured LLM contracts/cache, and bounded controller tests |
| Identity and workflow | Implemented in models and local contracts | Identity handling, primary/foreign identity logic, workflow replay structures, object/tenant differential evidence models |
| Surface and coverage intelligence | Implemented and locally verified | SurfaceEvidenceGraph, CoverageLedger, route discovery, bounded crawler/supplement logic, imported-observation projection |
| AutoPentestX integration | Implemented as import-only adapter | Redaction, same-origin checks, provenance, action-ledger context, budget metadata, malformed-input fail-closed behavior, AST no-direct-I/O guard |
| External-tool benchmark value | Not established | Requires controlled ablation runs; no live target was contacted |
| WAPTLab/Juice Shop qualification | Not executed in this loop | Explicitly skipped by user request |
| Release signing | Not configured | SHA-256 manifest is integrity evidence, not a cryptographic signature; operator signing remains required |

## Verification results

| Gate | Result |
|---|---:|
| Full pytest | **981 passed, 0 failures** |
| Ruff | **0 errors** |
| Compileall | **Pass** |
| Unified `verify_all.py` audit | **145 pass, 0 fail** |
| Git diff check | **Pass** |
| pip-audit | **No known vulnerabilities found** |
| Bandit | **0 High, 4 Medium, 63 Low**; Medium findings are documented in `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md` |
| WAPTLab contact in this loop | **None** |
| WAPTLab modification in this loop | **None** |

The Bandit result is reported truthfully. The four Medium and 63 Low findings are not silently converted into zero-risk claims. They are retained for triage and hardening review, while the critical/high security gate remains clear.

## Residual gates

The following items remain open because they require target-backed or environment-backed evidence rather than source presence or unit tests:

1. Three independent clean benchmark runs proving at least 15 of 20 confirmed WAPTLab vulnerabilities.
2. Precision, recall, reproducibility, and false-positive measurements against a known-positive/known-negative registry.
3. Browser/Chromium, OOB, body-bearing HTTP, authenticated workflow, second-identity, API/GraphQL, parser, and multipart qualification.
4. ZAP/Katana/Crawlee, Schemathesis/REST-Attacker/Wapiti, Dalfox, mitmproxy, Nuclei, HTTPx, Subfinder, and GraphQL adapter ablation evidence.
5. Broker redelivery, multi-worker, worker restart, rollback, and production Docker qualification.
6. Cryptographic release signing by an operator-controlled private key.
7. Final Bandit Medium/Low triage and any required hardening changes.

These items are deliberately marked residual. They must not be represented as completed merely because a module, manifest, or unit test exists.

## Release boundary

The release preserves WebPent as the authority layer. AutoPentestX orchestration, direct exploit execution, independent scope, duplicate reporting truth, and uncontrolled subprocess/network authority were not merged. External records remain untrusted enrichment or observation input and cannot create a Finding or Tool-Confirmed result without WebPent validation, causal evidence, negative control, and ProofBundle custody.

No WAPTLab or other target was started, contacted, modified, or used to produce evidence during this release review.

## Source-of-truth documents

- `docs/vip_final_compliance_matrix.md`
- `docs/bandit_triage_vip.md`
- `docs/autopentestx_selective_integration.md`
- `docs/autopentestx_selective_integration_audit.md`
- `docs/autopentestx_plan_compliance.md`
- `docs/release_manifest.json`

The release is therefore classified as **Evidence-Aware Bounded Autonomous Bug Hunter / Smart Research Beta**, not as a completed VIP release.
