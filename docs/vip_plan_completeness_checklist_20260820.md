# WebPent VIP Plan Completeness Checklist

**Review date:** 2026-08-20
**Workspace:** `/tmp/webpent_v72_git_recovered`
**Constraint:** This review and implementation pass are local-only. WAPTLab and Juice Shop were not started, contacted, or modified.
**Decision rule:** A module name, feature flag, README statement, or isolated unit test is not sufficient for `complete`; the status below requires source evidence plus a relevant contract test or local artifact.
**Reviewer signature:** WebPent local verification pass — 2026-08-20

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `already implemented and reused` | Source and local contract evidence exist; no duplicate added. |
| `implemented but needs wiring` | A component exists, but production-path invocation or enforcement is not proven. |
| `implemented but needs hardening` | The path exists but still lacks a release-grade control or test. |
| `new implementation` | Added in this or an earlier local pass with tests. |
| `rejected with rationale` | Deliberately not imported because it would create a second authority, unsafe behavior, duplication, or unacceptable noise. |
| `blocked by legal/tooling constraints` | Cannot be honestly completed under the current no-lab/no-external-execution or licensing constraint. |

## Deliverables status

| Deliverable | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Existing-capability/de-dup inventory | new implementation | `docs/vip_source_runtime_inventory_20260820.md`, this checklist |
| Source/security/privacy/dependency/license reports | implemented but needs hardening | `docs/vip_source_reports.md`, AutoPentestX audit, existing project audit | Exact pinned source/license review for every optional priority project remains incomplete where the plan did not provide a source checkout. |
| Integration decision matrix | implemented and locally verified | `docs/integration_decision_matrix.md`, `docs/vip_source_reports.md`, and this checklist | Live useful-coverage comparison remains unmeasured. |
| Native adapter contracts/manifests | already implemented and reused | Nettacker/AutoPentestX adapters and capability manifest |
| Direct-I/O execution-plane proof | implemented and locally verified | AST tests, source inventory, `verify_all.py`, `scripts/verify_release_artifacts.py` | Runtime qualification remains local-only. |
| WAPTLab/Juice Shop benchmark report | blocked by legal/tooling constraints | No targets run by instruction |
| Failure-injection/recovery report | implemented but needs hardening | `benchmarks/failure_matrix.py`, `scripts/evaluate_failure_matrix.py`, `docs/vip_failure_injection_report.md`, `docs/vip_failure_matrix_20260820.json`, dedicated tests | Full worker/tool/broker matrix remains deferred. |

## Pass 2 local additions

This pass added and tested the bounded offline failure-injection matrix. It covers validator dispositions (`reviewable`, `inconclusive`, and `blocked`) and active-research boundaries (`blocked`, `infrastructure_failure`, and safe negative observation). The generated JSON artifact is explicitly marked as non-live and cannot create or promote a Finding.

The authority and ProofBundle regression suites were also added to the local tree; they exercise scope, approval, destructive denial, idempotency, sealing, replay, redaction, and negative-control contracts without network access. This pass additionally added `scripts/verify_release_artifacts.py`, `docs/vip_operator_runbook.md`, `docs/vip_rollback_plan.md`, and `docs/vip_source_reports.md`; the audit tool verifies release hashes and archive redaction offline and fails closed when an operator requires a detached signature.

## Honest conclusion

The plan is **not 100% complete end-to-end** under the explicit no-WAPTLab constraint. All locally executable engineering work must still pass the final release gate, but the following cannot be marked complete without live authorized artifacts: WAPTLab/Juice Shop ground truth, all ablation runs, 15+/20 confirmations, precision, reproducibility, live browser/OOB/API/parser qualification, and production worker/container qualification.

This is not a failure of the local implementation; it is an evidence boundary. The system must not claim VIP status or confirmed vulnerabilities from module existence, offline fixtures, or unit tests.
