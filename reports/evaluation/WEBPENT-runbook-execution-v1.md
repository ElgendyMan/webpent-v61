# WebPent Autonomous Engineering and Validation Runbook — Execution Report v1

**Execution status:** `COMPLETED_WITH_GOVERNED_BLOCKERS`

**Scope:** local loopback validation only. No public target, Bug Bounty program, OAST endpoint, SSRF callback, authentication bypass, OTP/MFA/CAPTCHA bypass, destructive action, raw response, cookie, credential, token, or raw DOM artifact was used.

## 1. Baseline and provenance

The runbook baseline was captured before the final validation pass. The WebPent source revision was `080d01de6144442aaf3667c950c92519e53fb4a8` with tree `16ef2d1de002e3fae8bfeabf667504d6e326f77f`. The active controlled target was Juice Shop `20.2.0`, whose source commit is `1618a611b173b4bf114028e6e02549950606e29d`. These are distinct identities: the first identifies the WebPent source revision that contains the adapters, governance documents, validators, and manifests; the second identifies the Juice Shop application source used as the local target.

Juice Shop was verified on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` only. The runtime manifest records the loopback-only binding and disabled OTEL exporters with no external OTLP endpoint. No official qualification process was present during the final check.

## 2. Governance state

The corrected governance packet remains `PENDING_INDEPENDENT_GOVERNANCE_SIGNOFF`. It is prepared for human review, not approved by the implementer. No reviewer identity or human signature was fabricated. `official_isolated_p10_runs_authorized` remains `false`.

The current proposed scoring set contains three cases and three vulnerability classes:

| Case | Current governance state |
|---|---|
| `juice.error_handling.v1` | proposed oracle-approved set; not full P10 qualification |
| `juice.exposed_metrics.v1` | proposed oracle-approved set; not full P10 qualification |
| `juice.local_xss.v1` | proposed oracle-approved set; not full P10 qualification |

The set remains below the P10 minimum of ten cases and six classes. Signing the packet would not, by itself, open the official run gate.

## 3. Drift and reconciliation work

The source-to-governance drift was corrected and made explicit rather than hidden. The source-to-ground-truth manifest now records the actual WebPent source revision and tree, the Juice Shop source identity, the current mapping state, and the access-log discrepancy. The frozen ground-truth document was not modified to make the drift disappear.

The access-log distinction remains a governance item requiring human resolution. The frozen ground truth refers to `/ftp/access.log`, while the current Juice Shop source mapping resolves to `/support/logs/access.log.2026-08-26`. The current implementation is therefore recorded as `implemented_pending_independent_governance_confirmation`; it is not silently promoted into the official scoring set.

The oracle material distinguishes the historical reviewed hash from the current source-derived oracle contract hash. The current contract requires renewed independent confirmation. The release manifest was regenerated with explicit provenance scope and excludes itself, audit evidence, scratch files, and local artifacts from its source inventory.

The earlier `7` versus `8` discrepancy was reconciled without changing case outcomes. The authoritative Juice Shop 11-case mapping has eight non-scoring cases: one implemented but pending governance confirmation, three blocked, and four out of scope. Seven is the count of synthetic fixture cases tracked in a separate engineering context and is not the authoritative Juice Shop count. Additional frozen excluded rows are tracked separately and are not merged into the scoring set.

## 4. Quality loop results

### Mock Target

The Mock improvement cycle remains closed. The default fixture is blocked, while the ready fixture is opt-in and passes through the GenericCaseRunner, central verifier, independent negative control, sealed ProofBundle, seal verification, replay, redaction, and neutrality regressions. No Generic Core or frozen P10 artifact was changed for this runbook pass.

### Juice Shop

A bounded read-only local inventory was executed with run ID `runbook-juice-baseline-20260826`. The artifact contains thirteen safe inventory rows, with metrics withheld and no qualification claim. The result is an engineering baseline, not an official P10 run. The previously approved baseline evaluation remains `p10_passed=false` with metrics withheld because the approval count, class count, isolated-run count, and live proof requirements are incomplete.

The local run produced known non-fatal Playwright shutdown noise after the bounded operation. The artifact itself was inspected; it contains only redacted metadata and no raw response, cookie, or credential material. The noise is recorded as operational technical debt and is not converted into a finding or a success claim.

### WebGoat and crAPI portability

No authorized local WebGoat or crAPI instance was available in the environment. No external instance was contacted and no unapproved target was provisioned. WebGoat portability is therefore `BLOCKED_NO_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_INSTANCE`. crAPI portability is `BLOCKED_NO_AUTHORIZED_LOCAL_INSTANCE`; distributed or Docker-based provisioning was not performed under the project safety boundary. These blockers are explicit and do not count as FN.

## 5. Validation gates

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| Corrected governance validator | PASS |
| Full pytest | 1900 passed |
| P10 review tests | 17 passed |
| Juice Shop contract tests | 7 passed |
| Ruff | PASS |
| Compileall | PASS |
| Direct-I/O scan | PASS |

| G-02 runtime | PASS; no external target contacted |
| G-02 precommit | PASS; no external target contacted |
| Tracked secret scan | PASS |
| Git diff check | PASS |

## 6. Final qualification decision

The runbook was executed to the maximum safe and auditable extent available in the current environment. The remaining blockers are governance and evidence gates, not reasons to fabricate a result.

```text

```

Official P10 runs may begin only after a real independent reviewer verifies the archive provenance and hashes, resolves the access-log mapping, re-approves the current oracle contract, and records all eight authoritative non-scoring decisions. Even then, the run gate remains closed until the final approved set reaches at least ten cases and six classes and every approved case has a causal oracle, safe precondition, independent negative control, central verification, sealed/replayable ProofBundle, successful seal verification, and replay.
