# src/webpent/agents/recon/agent.py
"""webpent.agents.recon.agent

LangGraph node that performs the recon phase of an engagement.

The recon node chains three ProjectDiscovery tools:

  1. ``subfinder`` — passive subdomain enumeration for the target root
     domain.
  2. ``httpx`` — live-host probing of every discovered subdomain.
  3. ``nuclei`` — template-based vulnerability scanning of the primary
     target URL.

The node is intentionally resilient: a failure in subfinder or httpx
does not abort nuclei, and a failure in nuclei does not discard the
subdomains already discovered. All usable observations are converted
into :class:`Finding` instances and returned to the graph.

PortSwigger lab mode:
    When ``target.is_portswigger_lab`` is ``True``, subdomain enumeration
    is skipped entirely (lab environments are single-tenant with no
    meaningful subdomain surface). ``httpx`` is invoked directly against
    the lab host so that live-host probing / tech-fingerprint data is
    still collected. The summary message reflects the active mode so
    logs and reports stay accurate.

Record-conversion resilience:
    Nuclei records are converted to ``Finding`` models with per-item
    error isolation. A single malformed record (e.g. a non-absolute
    ``matched-at`` URL that fails Pydantic validation) is logged and
    skipped rather than aborting the entire scan's findings. The
    ``url`` field is also sanitised inside ``_nuclei_record_to_finding``
    as defense-in-depth: any value that does not start with ``http://``
    or ``https://`` falls back to the engagement's primary target URL.
