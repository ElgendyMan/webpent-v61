V7 Sprint 2.3 — HTTP Request Smuggling Detection.

Detects HTTP request smuggling (CL.TE, TE.CL, TE.TE) by sending
deliberately malformed requests with conflicting Content-Length and
Transfer-Encoding headers, then observing differential responses.

Per V7 Architectural Plan §2.3: this introduces genuinely new attack
surface for WebPent's own network layer. The detection uses
``httpx`` with raw HTTP (not the SSRF-pinning transport, since
smuggling requires sending non-standard header combinations that the
pinning transport would rewrite). All requests are still gated by
the engagement-scope allowlist and the SSRF blocklist — the smuggling probe
only sends to the target URL (which has already been validated by
the scope_enforcer).

Safety controls:
  * Per V7 P0: the engagement-scope allowlist
    (``webpent.shared.engagement_scope``) restricts SSRF-guard
    exemptions to the operator-declared target host only. The
    removed Dev Mode / ``mock_target_hosts`` framework no longer
    exists.
  * Per Principle 2 (fail-closed): if the probe encounters an error,
    it logs and returns — it does NOT attempt to exploit the
    smuggling vector.
  * The probe sends only TWO requests per vector (one probe, one
    detection request) to minimize network impact.
