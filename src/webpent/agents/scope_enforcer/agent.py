# src/webpent/agents/scope_enforcer/agent.py
"""webpent.agents.scope_enforcer.agent

LangGraph node that enforces target scope by filtering out-of-scope URLs.

V3.5 Phase 2 introduces strict scope enforcement. The ``Target`` model's
``is_in_scope(url)`` method is used to validate every URL in the
engagement state. Findings whose URLs are out of scope are discarded,
and crawled endpoints that fall outside the scope are filtered out.

This node runs immediately after the crawler and before the WAF detector
to ensure no out-of-scope data propagates downstream.

V4.5 Kill-Switch: The entire core logic is wrapped in a ``try/except``
block. On ANY unexpected exception, the node raises a critical error
(FAIL-CLOSED). It NEVER returns a default "in-scope" status or bypasses
the scope check.
