# src/webpent/agents/validator/agent.py
"""webpent.agents.validator.agent

LangGraph node that validates findings using a Hybrid Supervisor
architecture with deterministic trust layering.

V3.5 Changes:
  * Replaced keyword-based ``_classify_finding`` with the deterministic
    ``finding.vuln_class`` Enum field.
  * Implemented Incremental Persistence: confirmed findings are saved to
    the SQLite database immediately via ``DatabaseManager().save_finding()``,
    not delayed until graph execution concludes.
  * Implemented Trust Layering: added deterministic checks for specific
    success keywords in tool stdout (e.g., "is vulnerable" for SQLMap)
    alongside the LLM verdict, rather than relying solely on the LLM.
  * Integrated ``safe_prompt_format`` for prompt-injection defence.

# SQLi findings on non-vulnerable targets with zero human/LLM check.

# sqli now goes through tools.exploitation.sqlmap.parse_sqlmap_confirmation()

    V9 P0 Fix-Persist: one bounded retry on failure. The API's
    ``/findings`` endpoint reads from the database
    (``db.get_findings_by_thread``), not from live graph state, so a
    write failure here is not just a logging concern — without a
    retry, a finding can be reported as "Tool-Confirmed" within this
    run's own output while never appearing via the DB-backed API/report
    at all. A single retry after a short pause is a bounded mitigation
    for transient failures; it does not fix a persistently broken DB
    (disk full, permissions, corrupt schema) — those still surface via
    the ERROR log below and the ``persistence_failed`` evidence flag
    set by the call sites.

    V10 P0-C FIX: stamp ``thread_id`` on the finding BEFORE saving.
    The previous version saved the finding as-is, relying on the
    worker's final ``_persist_findings(final_state, thread_id=...)``
    call to stamp thread_id via ``model_copy``. But if the worker
    dies with an uncatchable signal (SIGKILL/OOM) before reaching
    that final persist — OR if the graph false-completes (P0-0) so
    the normal-completion branch never fires — the mid-scan rows
    remain in the DB with ``thread_id=NULL`` and are invisible to
    the API's ``WHERE thread_id = ?`` query. The operator sees
    "Incrementally persisted finding X" in the logs but
    ``GET /findings`` returns ``[]`` for the same thread_id.

    Fix: accept ``thread_id`` as an optional parameter and stamp it
    on the finding before saving. The call sites in ``validator_node``
    now read ``thread_id`` from state (which the worker populates at
    engagement start) and pass it through. The worker's final
    ``_persist_findings`` still stamps (and re-saves via INSERT OR
    REPLACE) as a belt-and-suspenders repair for any pre-V10 rows.

    Returns:
        ``True`` if the finding was persisted successfully (on the
        first attempt or the retry).

#   2. Inject the OOB URL into the vulnerable parameter of finding.url

#   3. Issue the crafted request via httpx.
#   4. Poll the DB for up to ``oob_poll_timeout_seconds`` seconds.

# causes the target to execute the embedded command, which we observe
# indirectly via an OOB callback.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Build an OOB URL via the existing _build_oob_url helper.
#   2. Generate two candidate payloads whose command pings the OOB URL:
#        a) ysoserial payload (Java targets — CommonsCollections, etc.)
#        b) phpggc payload    (PHP targets — Symfony, Laravel, etc.)
#   3. Inject each payload into the suspected vulnerable parameter of
#      finding.url and POST it via httpx (deserialization payloads are
#      typically delivered via POST bodies, but we also try GET for
#      URL-parameter-based sinks).
#   4. Poll the DB for an OOB callback. If either payload triggered a
#      callback, the finding is Tool-Confirmed. If both tools are
#      missing, or no callback arrives, fail closed to human review.

    # V6 Absolute-Flawless P0 FIX (CISO audit — ysoserial Payload Corruption):
    #   The previous code did ``payload_bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")``
    #   on the ysoserial output. ysoserial emits raw Java serialized bytes
    #   that contain arbitrary byte values (including 0x80-0xFF) which are
    #   NOT valid UTF-8. Decoding with ``errors="replace"`` substitutes
    #   U+FFFD for every invalid byte, irreversibly corrupting the
    #   serialized stream — the target's deserializer would then reject
    #   the payload as malformed and the OOB callback would never fire,
    #   silently turning a true positive into a false negative.
    #
    #   The fix: keep the ysoserial payload as raw ``bytes``. The
    #   ``payloads_to_try`` tuple now stores ``(tool, gadget, payload)``
    #   where ``payload`` is ``bytes`` for ysoserial and ``str`` for
    #   phpggc (which emits text-safe PHP-serialized strings). Stage 2
    #   dispatches bytes payloads via ``client.post(..., content=payload)``
    #   and string payloads via ``client.post(..., data={...})`` /
    #   URL-encoding, so each tool's payload is transmitted in its
    #   native format without any lossy encode/decode round-trip.

      1. The tool executes successfully, AND

      3. The LLM supervisor returns YES.

    Findings without a dedicated tool are assigned
    ``confidence_level = "Needs Human Review"`` with a recorded coverage
    gap; they are never promoted by an LLM-only confirmation.

    V5: CSRF has a deterministic structural validation tool that
    checks for missing anti-CSRF tokens in HTML forms.

    V5 Sprint 6: ``stealth_mode`` is threaded through to the tool
    wrappers (dalfox/sqlmap) and to the deserialization validator so
    jitter + rate-limiting is applied when stealth is enabled.

    V5 Sprint 8: ``playwright_enabled`` + ``auth_state`` are threaded
    through to ``_validate_csrf`` so the CSRF check can use
    Playwright-rendered DOM (avoiding SPA false positives) with
    authenticated session cookies.

    V9 P0-B HOTFIX: ``credentials`` + ``target_url`` are threaded
    through so the dead-session branch below can attempt ONE re-login
    (via the same Playwright helper auth_node uses) when the operator
    supplied credentials, instead of unconditionally punting to
    "Needs Human Review". No credentials -> unchanged fail-closed
    behavior. See the dead-session block for the full decision tree.

    V10 P0-2 Option A: ``thread_id`` is threaded through so the dead-
    session branch can look up the sealed re-auth secret in the worker-
    only vault (src/webpent/auth/reauth_vault.py) when FIX-10 has
    scrubbed ``credentials["password"]`` to ``""`` after a successful
    initial login. The vault is the sole source of truth for re-auth
    once the checkpointed password is gone. If the vault is also empty
    (worker restarted, or operator never supplied credentials), the
    branch falls through to the explicit fail-loud path:
    ``reauth_unavailable`` evidence + Needs Human Review + ERROR log.

    On confirmation, the finding is immediately persisted to the database.

    When the validator records a specific failure reason on a finding
    (see _classify_validator_failure), this helper:

      1. Looks up the related hypothesis via ``finding.hypothesis_id``
         (the back-reference set by promote_hypothesis_to_finding).
      2. Applies a deterministic confidence delta via
         :func:`apply_online_learning_delta` — the delta is keyed by
         the failure reason, mapping 1:1 to the OnlineLearningEvent
         enum values added in V8 P0 D3.
      3. Returns the updated hypothesis (confidence_score adjusted,
         clamped to [0, 1]) AND a Decision Log entry recording the
         learning event.

    Pure deterministic — NO LLM, NO free-form memory. The delta
    magnitudes are fixed in ``ONLINE_LEARNING_DELTAS`` and bounded by
    the cumulative cap in ``compute_confidence_score`` (which clamps
    to [0, 1]). No unbounded learning behavior is introduced.

    Args:
        finding: The unconfirmed finding, with
            ``evidence["validation_failure_reason"]`` set by
            ``_classify_validator_failure``.
        hypotheses: The current ``state["hypotheses"]`` list. The
            helper searches for a hypothesis whose ``id`` matches
            ``finding.hypothesis_id``.

    Returns:
        A tuple of ``(updated_hypotheses, decision_log_entries)``.
        ``updated_hypotheses`` is a list of 0 or 1 Hypothesis objects
        (the matched hypothesis with its confidence_score adjusted).
        ``decision_log_entries`` is a list of 0 or 1 Decision Log
