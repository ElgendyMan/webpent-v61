"""webpent.api.app

FastAPI application exposing the WebPent Framework V3 as a backend
service with HITL approval, auto_approve bypass, and status monitoring.

Endpoints:
  * ``POST /api/v1/scans`` — trigger a new pentest engagement.
  * ``GET /api/v1/scans/{thread_id}/status`` — check engagement status.
  * ``POST /api/v1/scans/{thread_id}/approve`` — approve a paused engagement.
  * ``GET /api/v1/scans/{thread_id}/findings`` — retrieve persisted findings.
  * ``GET/POST /api/oob/{finding_id}/{secret}`` — V5 Sprint 5 OOB callback
    receiver used to confirm SSRF/RCE findings whose exploitation causes
    the target to call back to this framework instance.

# concurrent get_scan_status requests can race on the check-then-set
# pattern below — double build_graph, or thread A reading thread B's
# checkpointer (which B closes on with-exit) before A calls get_state.
_GRAPH_CACHE_LOCK = threading.Lock()


def _get_cached_graph(checkpointer: Any) -> Any:
    """Return a cached compiled graph, rebuilding only if auto_approve changed.

    V9 HOSTILE-AUDIT FIX (FIX-5 regression): the original version cached
    the graph object returned by ``build_graph(checkpointer=checkpointer)``
    on the FIRST call and reused it forever, silently ignoring the
    ``checkpointer`` argument on every subsequent call. Every caller
    (``_get_graph_status``) opens its checkpointer via
    ``with get_checkpointer() as checkpointer:`` — a fresh, per-request
    connection that is CLOSED when that ``with`` block exits. Because the
    cached graph kept a permanent reference to the first request's
    (now-closed) checkpointer, every status poll after the first raised
    ``sqlite3.ProgrammingError: Cannot operate on a closed database``,
    which the outer handler silently caught and reported as
    ``{"status": "error"}`` for the remaining lifetime of the worker
    process — i.e. this "fix" broke status polling after exactly one
    call.

    Fix: still build (and cache) the compiled graph TOPOLOGY only once —
    that is the expensive part FIX-5 was trying to avoid rebuilding —
    but rebind the cheap ``.checkpointer`` attribute to the CURRENT,
    live checkpointer on every call, cache hit or not. Verified against
    langgraph 1.2.10 / langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite 3.1.1: a compiled
    ``CompiledStateGraph`` exposes ``.checkpointer`` as a plain, settable
    attribute that ``get_state``/``invoke`` read at call time, so this
    reassignment is honored correctly. Re-verify this attribute name
    against whatever langgraph version this project's environment
    actually resolves (pyproject.toml only pins ``>=0.2.0``) before
    relying on it in production.

    V10 AUDIT FIX (H5): the cache dict and .checkpointer reassignment
    are now protected by ``_GRAPH_CACHE_LOCK`` to prevent the
    check-then-set race between concurrent status-poll requests.

    """V6 DX-Final P1: Shared trusted-proxy IP extraction.

    Returns the real client IP address, honoring ``X-Forwarded-For``
    and ``X-Real-IP`` headers **only** when the direct TCP peer is in
    ``trusted_ips``. This closes a regression in ``start_scan`` that
    allowed any client to spoof its IP via the ``X-Forwarded-For``
    header and bypass the per-IP scan rate limit.

    The same logic was originally implemented inline in
    ``rate_limit_middleware``. It is now extracted into this helper
    so the middleware and ``start_scan`` cannot drift out of sync.

    V6 DX-Final P1 FIX (CISO audit): The previous implementation read
    the **leftmost** ``X-Forwarded-For`` entry, which is fully
    attacker-controlled — any client could prepend an arbitrary IP
    to the header to spoof its identity and bypass per-IP rate
    limiting. The corrected implementation iterates the XFF chain
    **right-to-left**, skipping every entry that belongs to a
    configured trusted proxy. The first non-trusted IP encountered
    from the right is the authentic client IP. If every entry is a
    trusted proxy (unusual but valid for multi-hop reverse-proxy
    chains), we fall back to ``xff_entries[0]`` to preserve the
    original-client semantics for fully-trusted chains.

            header is trusted. An empty list disables header trust
            entirely (every request is attributed to its TCP peer).

    Returns:
        The client IP string to use for rate-limit keying. Falls back

    V10 P0-0 FIX: the previous version conflated two distinct conditions
    into a single ``status="completed"`` return:
      (a) the engagement ran to completion (checkpoint exists, ``next == ()``)
      (b) NO checkpoint exists yet for this thread_id (worker still
          queued or starting up — ``get_state`` returns None or an empty
          StateSnapshot with ``next=()``)
    Both produced ``next_nodes == []`` and the handler returned
    ``"completed"`` for case (b), causing the live operator symptom:
    POST /scans → ~1s later GET /status returns ``completed`` while the
    worker is still actively running.

    Fix: distinguish "no checkpoint" (``state_snapshot is None`` OR
    ``not state_snapshot.values``) from "checkpoint with empty next"
    (genuine completion). The former returns ``"pending"`` (a NEW
    status value meaning "engagement queued or worker starting —
    no checkpoint written yet"); the latter returns ``"completed"``.
    The Celery cross-check in ``get_scan_status`` then overrides
    ``"pending"`` to ``"running"`` if AsyncResult.state confirms the
    task is in-flight.

    V10 P0-0 FIX: the previous version conflated "no checkpoint yet"
    with "completed" (see ``_get_graph_status`` docstring) and relied
    on ``inspect.active()`` (a broadcast + string-match with a 5s
    timeout) to catch the false-completed case. ``inspect.active()``
    misses tasks that are still QUEUED in Redis (Celery state PENDING,
    not yet picked up by a worker) and times out on unresponsive
    workers — both leaving the false "completed" in place.

    The fix uses ``AsyncResult(task_id).state`` as the AUTHORITATIVE
    Celery signal, looked up via the thread_id → task_id mapping
    persisted by POST /scans (see ``scan_registry``). The decision
    matrix is:

      AsyncResult.state   | graph_status    | final status
      --------------------+-----------------+-------------
      PENDING / STARTED / | (any)           | "running"
      RETRY               |
      SUCCESS             | "completed"     | "completed"
      SUCCESS             | "pending"/"running"/"paused" | graph_status
      (trust graph — task returned but checkpoint may be mid-write)
      FAILURE / REVOKED   | (any)                         | "error"
      (lookup failed)     | "completed"                   | "completed"
      (fallback — trust graph, can't cross-check)
      (lookup failed)     | "pending"       | "running" (fallback — be conservative)
      (lookup failed)     | "running"/"paused"/"error" | graph_status (trust graph)

    The previous ``inspect.active()`` path is kept as a TERTIARY
    fallback for the case where both AsyncResult and the registry
    are unavailable (e.g. the scan was dispatched by an older API
    version that didn't persist the mapping).

# =========================================================================== #
# V5 Sprint 5 — Out-of-Band (OOB) callback receiver                          #
# =========================================================================== #
# The OOB endpoint is what makes deterministic SSRF/RCE confirmation
# possible. The validator injects a URL pointing here into the target's
# vulnerable parameter; if the target server reaches out to fetch that
# URL, the SSRF/RCE is confirmed objectively (no LLM in the loop).
#
# Security model (defense-in-depth):
#   1. ``finding_id`` MUST be a syntactically-valid UUID. Anything else
#      is rejected with 400 before touching the DB. This blocks path
#      traversal / SQLi via the path parameter.
#   2. ``secret`` MUST match ``Settings.oob_callback_secret``. The
#      secret is part of the URL the validator itself constructs and
#      injects; an attacker who can observe the target's request log
#      would still need to guess the secret to forge a callback. When
#      the secret is empty (default), OOB confirmation is disabled
#      entirely (fail-safe — the endpoint returns 503).
#   3. The endpoint only mutates the specific finding whose UUID is in
#      the path; it does not accept any body that could override the
#      finding's identity. The request body is read with a hard 4 KB
#      ceiling and truncated before being recorded into the reasoning
#      trail, preventing a malicious target from blowing up the DB row.
#   4. The endpoint writes to the DB via the same thread-safe
