"""webpent.api.scan_registry

V10 P0-0 fix: thread_id ↔ task_id mapping store.

Problem
-------
POST /api/v1/scans generates a ``thread_id`` (uuid4) for the LangGraph
configurable, dispatches ``run_pentest_task.delay(...)`` which returns a
Celery ``task_id``, and returns BOTH to the client. But the mapping is
never persisted anywhere — not in DB, not in Redis, not in memory.

GET /api/v1/scans/{thread_id}/status only has ``thread_id``. To consult
``AsyncResult(task_id).state`` (the authoritative Celery signal —
PENDING / STARTED / SUCCESS / FAILURE / RETRY), the API must be able to
look up the corresponding ``task_id``.

This module provides a minimal, dependency-free mapping store backed by
SQLite (the same DB the findings table lives in). It is intentionally
NOT Redis-backed to avoid adding a new failure mode; SQLite is already
a hard dependency.

Schema
------
A single table ``scan_engagements``:

    thread_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY
    task_id      TEXT NOT NULL
    target_url   TEXT
    created_at   TEXT NOT NULL
    status       TEXT  -- 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'terminated'

The table is created idempotently on first use (CREATE TABLE IF NOT
EXISTS). No alembic migration is needed — this is a self-contained
registry, not part of the findings schema.

Thread-safety
-------------
All public functions acquire the DatabaseManager's ``_write_lock``
(mutual exclusion with findings writes) for writes, and use the shared
``_connect()`` context for reads. SQLite handles concurrent reads
natively; writes are serialised by the lock.
