# src/webpent/integrations/webhook.py
"""webpent.integrations.webhook

V5 Sprint 11 — Enterprise webhook / ticketing integration.

Pushes actionable findings (``"Tool-Confirmed"`` and
``"Needs Human Review"``) to external systems via HTTP webhook. The
payload format is compatible with Slack incoming webhooks, Discord
webhooks, and Jira REST API (with minor adaptation by the receiver).

Usage::

    import asyncio
    from webpent.integrations.webhook import push_to_webhook, maybe_push_finding

    # Direct push (async):
    await push_to_webhook(finding, "https://hooks.slack.com/services/...")

    # Settings-gated push (respects WEBHOOK_ENABLED + WEBHOOK_URL):
    await maybe_push_finding(finding)

# V6 Absolute-Flawless P0 FIX (Async SSRF Bypass): webhook.py was using
# a raw httpx.AsyncClient, bypassing the SSRF guard installed by
# make_safe_httpx_client. The webhook URL is attacker-controllable
# (set via WEBHOOK_URL), so an attacker could point it at internal
# services (169.254.169.254, redis:6379, etc.) and exfiltrate data
# via the webhook push. We now route through make_safe_httpx_async_client
# which installs BOTH the redirect-block event hook AND the
# DNS-pinning transport — same defence-in-depth as the sync paths.
