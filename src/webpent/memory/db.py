        V7 Ready-For-Kali P0 FIX (found via empirical round-trip
        testing, not code review): the previous code did
        ``str(finding.confidence)`` etc. directly. For a
        ``class X(str, Enum)`` member, Python's bare ``str()`` returns
        the QUALIFIED repr form (``"Confidence.TENTATIVE"``), not the
        parseable value (``"tentative"``) -- confirmed empirically on
        this Python version. ``Confidence(row["confidence"])`` on read
        then raises ``ValueError`` immediately, for every single row.

        This "accidentally worked" in the real production pipeline
        ONLY because LangGraph's checkpointer msgpack round-trip
        happens to coerce these (str, Enum) fields down to plain
        strings before ``save_finding()`` is ever reached from
        ``pentest_worker.py`` -- so ``str()`` on the ALREADY-plain
        string was a harmless no-op there. It crashes immediately and
        reproducibly for any finding saved via a more direct path
        (any unit test; any future code that constructs and saves a
        Finding without first passing through a checkpoint round-trip
        -- e.g. exploit_chainer's freshly-created candidates, if they
        were ever persisted directly rather than via the graph). Not
        robust, not intentional -- accidental correctness in one
        specific call path, latent breakage everywhere else. Fixed by
        explicitly reading ``.value`` when present (true enum member)
        and falling back to the value itself when it's already a
        plain string (post-checkpoint case) — safe for both.

        V10 P1-10 FIX (save_finding vs mark_oob_confirmed clobber):
            ``_FINDINGS_INSERT`` uses ``INSERT OR REPLACE``, which
            overwrites ALL columns. The OOB callback endpoint calls
            :meth:`mark_oob_confirmed`, which performs a TARGETED
            ``UPDATE`` of just four columns (``confidence_level`` →
            "Tool-Confirmed", ``confidence`` → CONFIRMED, ``reasoning``
            → existing+appendix, ``payload`` → marker). If the graph
            subsequently calls ``save_finding`` again for the same
            finding (e.g. CVSS engine updates the score, devils_advocate
            appends reasoning), the in-memory finding's SNAPSHOT of
            those four columns pre-dates the OOB confirmation — so the
            ``INSERT OR REPLACE`` silently clobbers the OOB-confirmed
            state back to the older in-memory values. The DB row
            appeared "Tool-Confirmed" briefly and then reverted, with
            no log and no audit trail.

            Fix: BEFORE the INSERT OR REPLACE, read the existing row.
            If the DB row's ``confidence_level`` is "Tool-Confirmed"
            AND the in-memory finding is at a LOWER confidence (i.e.
            its ``confidence_level`` is NOT also "Tool-Confirmed"),
            preserve the DB's four OOB-confirmed columns by overriding
            the in-memory values used in the INSERT. This makes
            ``save_finding`` idempotent w.r.t. OOB confirmations: a
            Tool-Confirmed row cannot be silently downgraded by a
            later graph-state save. When the in-memory finding is
            ALSO Tool-Confirmed (e.g. the validator re-confirmed via
            a different path), the in-memory values win — that is the
            intended behaviour, since the in-memory state is fresher.

# V6 DX-Final P0 FIX (CISO audit): Module-level singleton accessor.
# ======================================================================
# Previously, every caller in the framework instantiated
# ``DatabaseManager()`` independently (in ``api/app.py``,
# ``workers/pentest_worker.py``, ``agents/validator/agent.py``,
# ``agents/post_exploit/agent.py``, ``agents/execution_sandbox/agent.py``).
# Each construction created a fresh ``_write_lock`` (threading.Lock) and
# a fresh ``_initialised = False`` flag, which had two consequences:
#
#   1. The in-process write lock was effectively useless — concurrent
#      callers each held their own lock, so they could all enter the
#      critical section simultaneously and race on the SQLite writer.
#   2. ``init_db()`` was re-run by every caller, re-entering the
#      Alembic migration path (file lock acquisition, version check,
#      potential upgrade) on every request even when the database was
#      already initialised — producing needless serialization
#      bottlenecks on the migration lock file.
#
# The singleton below ensures every caller shares the SAME
# ``DatabaseManager`` instance, the SAME ``_write_lock``, and the SAME
# ``_initialised`` flag. ``init_db()`` therefore runs at most once per
# process lifetime, and all subsequent writes are properly serialized
# through the single shared lock.
# ======================================================================
