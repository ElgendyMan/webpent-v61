V7 Cognitive Upgrade — Phase 6: Decision Log.

A new append-only structured log, **distinct** from:

  * :attr:`Finding.reasoning` (per-finding justification), and
  * :attr:`PentestState.messages` (the chat transcript).

Each entry records one decision the system made (or deferred to a
human), with the deterministic rule that fired and the LLM's
contribution kept in a clearly separate field so they're never
confused. Persisted via a new SQLite table following the exact same
``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` + manager-class pattern already used
for ``findings`` and ``hypotheses``.

Per Phase 6 spec: "surfaced in the final report as an explainability
appendix — a natural extension of the project's existing audit-trail
ethos (``evidence_hash``, ``reasoning``, HMAC-signed master report
hash)."

Decision types (closed set — per Section 3 of the plan):

  * ``prioritization``           — Dynamic Prioritization ranked/sorted.
  * ``hypothesis_promoted``      — a Hypothesis was promoted to a Finding.
  * ``rabbit_hole_entered``      — a Rabbit Hole branch was entered.
  * ``rabbit_hole_abandoned``    — a Rabbit Hole branch was abandoned.
  * ``self_critique``            — Phase 5 Self-Critique fired.
  * ``scope_check``              — a scope check ran (initial or re-check).
  * ``risk_gate_blocked``        — the Risk Manager blocked an action.
