"""webpent.models.findings

Finding model for the WebPent Framework V3.5.

A ``Finding`` represents a single security observation produced by any
agent or tool during an engagement. Findings are aggregated by the
orchestrator and rendered into the final report.

V3.5 Changes:
  * Added :class:`VulnClass` enum to eliminate reliance on string matching
    within titles/descriptions for routing and classification.
  * Added ``vuln_class`` field to the :class:`Finding` model.
