V6 Omniscient Audit Fix (P0 — SSRF via HTTP Redirects)
=======================================================

A malicious target can answer an httpx request with a ``302 Found`` whose
``Location`` header points at an internal address such as
``http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`` (AWS instance metadata) or
``http://redis:6379/`` (an internal Docker service). When the calling
code constructs its client with ``follow_redirects=True``, httpx will
silently follow that redirect — effectively turning WebPent into an
SSRF proxy that exfiltrates cloud metadata or probes internal services
on behalf of the attacker.

This module provides two factories:

  * :func:`make_safe_httpx_client` — synchronous :class:`httpx.Client`
  * :func:`make_safe_httpx_async_client` — async :class:`httpx.AsyncClient`

Both return a standard httpx client augmented with TWO layers of SSRF
defense:

Layer 1 — ``response`` event-hook interceptor
    Inspects every 3xx response's ``Location`` header, resolves the
    redirect target's hostname via DNS, and raises
    :class:`SSRFRedirectBlockedError` (a subclass of
    :class:`httpx.RequestError`) if the resolved IP falls in any of
    the blocked internal networks:

      * ``127.0.0.0/8``       — IPv4 loopback
      * ``10.0.0.0/8``        — RFC 1918 private (Class A)
      * ``172.16.0.0/12``     — RFC 1918 private (Class B)
      * ``192.168.0.0/16``    — RFC 1918 private (Class C)
      * ``169.254.0.0/16``    — IPv4 link-local (AWS/GCP/Azure metadata)
      * ``::1/128``           — IPv6 loopback
      * ``fc00::/7``          — IPv6 unique-local (ULA)

Layer 2 — custom transport that pins the validated IP (V6 Absolute-Flawless)
    The hook validates the redirect target's DNS, but httpx resolves
    DNS a SECOND time when it actually opens the connection. A
    malicious DNS server can return a public IP for the first lookup
    (passing the hook) and an internal IP for the second lookup (when
    httpx connects) — the classic DNS-rebinding TOCTOU race.

    We close the race by installing a custom
    :class:`httpx.BaseTransport` (sync) / :class:`httpx.AsyncBaseTransport`
    (async) that:

      1. Resolves the request host once (via :func:`socket.getaddrinfo`).
      2. Checks every returned address against the blocklist —
         blocked IPs raise :class:`SSRFRedirectBlockedError` before
         any TCP connect.
      3. Re-writes the request URL's host to the validated IP literal
         so httpx's internal resolver never gets a chance to do a
         second, poisoned lookup. (The original ``Host`` header is
         preserved so virtual-hosted targets still route correctly.)

    This means even a DNS-rebinding attack that flips the A record
    between the hook's lookup and httpx's connect cannot land — the
    connection uses the EXACT IP the hook validated, not a fresh
    lookup. The hook and the transport share the same
    :func:`_is_blocked_host` checker, so the security posture is
    identical for origin requests and redirect targets.

V6 Absolute-Flawless P0 FIX (Async SSRF Bypass + DNS TOCTOU Race):
    The previous version only provided the sync factory. ``webhook.py``
    was using a raw ``httpx.AsyncClient`` and bypassing the guard
    entirely — an attacker-controlled webhook URL (set via
    ``WEBHOOK_URL``) could be pointed at internal services. The new
    :func:`make_safe_httpx_async_client` plugs that hole. Both
    factories now install the IP-pinning transport, closing the
    DNS-rebinding TOCTOU race that the hook alone could not prevent.

Usage
-----
Sync::

    from webpent.shared.http import make_safe_httpx_client
    with make_safe_httpx_client(timeout=10.0, follow_redirects=True, verify=True) as c:
        resp = c.get(url)

Async::

    from webpent.shared.http import make_safe_httpx_async_client
    async with make_safe_httpx_async_client(timeout=10.0, verify=True) as c:
        resp = await c.post(url, json=payload)

All caller-supplied keyword arguments (``timeout``, ``verify``,
``follow_redirects``, ``headers``, ``proxies``, etc.) are forwarded
verbatim to the underlying :class:`httpx.Client` /
:class:`httpx.AsyncClient`. Pre-existing user-supplied ``event_hooks``
are preserved and run alongside the SSRF guard. Pre-existing
``transport`` is honored ONLY if it is also an SSRFPinningTransport
instance; otherwise it is wrapped so the pinning runs first.

V7 P0 FIX (Private-IP auth/crawl blocker):
    The blocklist above previously had no concept of "this private IP
    is the engagement's own target" — it blocked an operator's own
    lab target (e.g. a DVWA VM at ``192.168.40.128``) exactly the same
    as it would block an attacker-controlled redirect to
    ``169.254.169.254``. That's correct for hosts discovered
    *mid-scan* but wrong for the engagement's declared target, which
    is the entire point of the framework.

    Every blocking chokepoint below (the sync/async pinning
    transports, the redirect guard, and the Playwright route/WebSocket
    guards) now consults
    :func:`webpent.shared.engagement_scope.is_engagement_target_host`
    before refusing a private/reserved-network host: if the host is
    the operator-declared engagement target, the connection is
    allowed even though it is RFC1918/loopback/link-local. Any OTHER
    private-network host — a redirect target, a crawled link, a
    webhook URL — is still blocked exactly as before. See
    ``shared/engagement_scope.py`` for how the allowlist is populated
    and scoped (one engagement's target per worker task/CLI run,
    never a process-wide setting).

    This replaces the old Dev-Mode ``mock_target_hosts`` allowlist,
    which has been removed entirely (see the P0 fix write-up): that
    allowlist was a separate, redundant mechanism that operators had
    to manage by hand and that did not even apply in Prod Mode, which
    was not the actual blocker for this bug.

            The previous implementation mutated ``request.url`` in
            place via ``request.url = httpx.URL(new_url)``. Two
            problems:

              1. In httpx 0.27.x, ``Request.url`` is a read-only
                 property — assignment raises ``AttributeError``.
                 The mutation only "worked" on 0.28+ where ``url``
                 happens to be a plain instance attribute, but even
                 there it was an undocumented escape hatch.

              2. More importantly: rewriting the URL host to the
                 pinned IP causes httpx's TLS layer to send the
                 IP (not the original hostname) as the SNI
                 (Server Name Indication) in the TLS ClientHello.
                 Many HTTPS targets — especially those behind CDNs
                 or name-based virtual hosts — reject connections
                 whose SNI doesn't match a configured vhost,
                 producing cryptic TLS handshake failures that
                 look like the target is down.

            The fix: instead of mutating the request, CONSTRUCT A
            NEW ``httpx.Request`` with the pinned-IP URL, copy the
            original headers (so the wire ``Host`` header still
            carries the DNS name), copy the stream (so the body is
            preserved), and — critically — set
            ``new_request.extensions["sni_hostname"] = host`` so
            the TLS layer sends the ORIGINAL hostname as SNI even
            though the TCP connection goes to the pinned IP. The
            underlying ``httpx.HTTPTransport`` reads
            ``extensions["sni_hostname"]`` and uses it verbatim for
            the SNI, overriding the URL-derived hostname.

            This gives us all three properties simultaneously:
              * TCP connects to the pinned IP (no DNS rebinding).
              * HTTP ``Host`` header carries the original DNS name
                (vhost routing works).
              * TLS SNI carries the original DNS name (CDN/vhost
                TLS handshake succeeds).

    The returned client behaves identically to a stock
    ``httpx.Client(**kwargs)`` — same timeout, same verify, same
    follow_redirects, same transport semantics — except that TWO
    layers of SSRF defence are installed:

      1. A ``response`` event-hook interceptor inspects every 3xx
         ``Location`` header and raises
         :class:`SSRFRedirectBlockedError` if the redirect target
         resolves to a blocked internal network.
      2. A custom :class:`SSRFPinningTransport` resolves every
         request host ONCE, validates every IP against the blocklist,
         and rewrites the request URL to the validated IP literal so
         httpx's internal resolver cannot be poisoned by a
         DNS-rebinding TOCTOU attack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs
        Forwarded verbatim to :class:`httpx.Client`. Commonly used
        keys include ``timeout``, ``verify``, ``follow_redirects``,
        ``headers``, ``max_redirects``, ``proxies``, and
        ``event_hooks``. If the caller supplies its own
        ``event_hooks``, those hooks are preserved and the SSRF
        guard is appended alongside them. If the caller supplies
        its own ``transport``, it is WRAPPED by the
        :class:`SSRFPinningTransport` so the SSRF check runs first
        and the caller's transport handles the actual TCP connect.

    Returns

    httpx.Client
        A configured, hardened client. Use it as a context manager

    V6 Final-Seal-Revised (CISO audit follow-up — Playwright DNS TOCTOU,
    corrected mechanism):
        This is the ONLY way to pin a Chromium connection to a
        pre-validated IP without breaking TLS SNI / certificate
        validation for HTTPS targets. Unlike rewriting the request URL
        (the original, broken approach — see
        :func:`install_playwright_ssrf_guard`'s docstring), a
        ``--host-resolver-rules=MAP host ip`` launch argument makes
        Chromium substitute ``ip`` only at the socket-connection layer;
        Chromium's TLS stack still believes it is talking to ``host``
        and sends ``host`` as SNI and validates the certificate against
        ``host``, exactly as if no pinning were in effect.

        Each hostname passed in is resolved ONCE, here, before the
        browser exists — closing the DNS-rebinding race for that host
        completely (there is no second, connection-time resolution to
        race against, because Chromium never resolves a MAP-covered
        host itself). Hostnames that fail resolution or resolve
        exclusively to blocked/internal addresses are SKIPPED (not
        included in the rule set) rather than raising, so callers can
        decide how to handle "target itself is unresolvable/internal"
        as an application-level concern (e.g. aborting the scan) rather
        than a transport-level exception; combined with the
        block-or-allow route handler installed by
        :func:`install_playwright_ssrf_guard`, a skipped/unpinned host
        still cannot reach a blocked network — it is simply not
        pinned, so ordinary (non-adversarial) DNS resolution applies
        and the route handler's live check is the backstop.

        IP literals (the host is already an address, not a DNS name)
        are skipped silently — there is nothing to pin.

    Args:
        *hostnames: One or more DNS names to pin (typically just the
            target URL's host; callers MAY add known auxiliary hosts,
            e.g. an auth redirect target known in advance, but cannot
            cover hosts only discovered at request time).

        A list suitable for ``playwright.chromium.launch(args=...)``.

        (the ambient engagement-scope allowlist), read ONCE here in
        the calling thread and captured by value in the handler
        closures below — NOT re-read per-request — because
        Playwright's Python sync API may invoke route-handler
        callbacks off the calling stack frame, where a
        ``contextvars.ContextVar`` lookup would not reliably see the
        value set by the caller. Any host that is not in this set is
        still blocked exactly as before, including other private IPs
        discovered mid-navigation (redirects, sub-resources).

    V6 Zero-Day Patched P0-1 FIX (CISO audit — Playwright SSRF Bypass):
        While ``httpx`` is secured against SSRF via the
        :class:`SSRFPinningTransport` and the ``response`` event-hook
        interceptor, Playwright's ``browser.new_context()`` has NO
        built-in network interception. Without an explicit ``route``
        handler, Playwright happily navigates to internal IP addresses
        (``169.254.169.254`` AWS metadata, ``redis:6379`` Docker DNS,
        ``127.0.0.1`` loopback, etc.) — turning the framework's own
        browser into an SSRF proxy that exfiltrates cloud metadata or
        probes internal services.

        This helper installs a ``context.route("**/*", handler)`` that
        inspects EVERY outgoing HTTP request (main-frame navigation,
        sub-resource fetches, XHR/fetch). The handler parses the request
        URL, extracts the hostname, and delegates to
        :func:`_is_blocked_host` — the same checker used by the
        httpx SSRF guard. If the host resolves to a blocked internal
        network, the request is aborted with
        ``route.abort("accessdenied")``; otherwise,
        ``route.continue_()`` lets it proceed normally.

    V6 The-Final-Seal P0-1 FIX, SUPERSEDED (CISO audit — Playwright
    WebSocket SSRF Bypass; corrected in V6 Ready-For-Kali):
        ``context.route("**/*")`` does NOT intercept WebSocket
        connections in Playwright. Malicious JavaScript can open a
        ``new WebSocket("ws://redis:6379")`` and bypass the HTTP route
        guard entirely — exfiltrating data or probing internal services
        over the WS protocol. This round attempted to ALSO install a
        ``context.routeWebSocket("**/*", _ssrf_websocket_handler)``
        that would inspect every outgoing WebSocket connection,
        resolve the hostname, and abort internal-network targets with
        ``route.abort("accessdenied")`` — but ``routeWebSocket``
        (camelCase) and ``route.abort()``/``route.continue_()`` are
        the **JavaScript/TypeScript** API shape. Neither exists on
        Python's ``BrowserContext`` (which only has
        ``route_web_socket``, snake_case) or on ``WebSocketRoute``
        (which has ``close()`` / ``connect_to_server()``, not
        ``abort()``/``continue_()``). Registration therefore always
        raised ``AttributeError``, was silently caught, and the
        WebSocket guard never actually installed — this fix shipped
        as dead code across two further audit rounds before being
        caught by a Python-API introspection check
        (``hasattr(BrowserContext, "route_web_socket")``) rather than
        by code review alone. See V6 Ready-For-Kali below for the
        corrected implementation.

    V6 Ready-For-Kali FIX (CISO audit — WebSocket guard corrected):
        Re-registers via ``context.route_web_socket("**/*", ...)``
        (the actual Python method name) with a handler matching the
        real single-argument ``WebSocketRoute`` callback contract.
        Blocking now means never calling ``ws.connect_to_server()``
        (Playwright opens no real network connection unless told to)
        plus an explicit ``ws.close(code=1008, reason="accessdenied")``
        so the page's JS observes an immediate, unambiguous failure.

    V6 The-Final-Seal P0-2 FIX, SUPERSEDED (CISO audit — Playwright DNS
    TOCTOU Race, revised after a follow-up review):
        The original P0-2 fix resolved DNS to check the host, then
        called ``route.continue_(url=safe_ip_url, headers={"Host":
        original_host})`` — rewriting the request URL to the pinned IP
        literal while preserving the DNS name only in the HTTP ``Host``
        header. That closed the DNS-rebinding race but broke HTTPS:
        Playwright's ``route.continue_()`` has no parameter to control
        the TLS SNI value, so Chromium derives SNI from the URL it is
        actually connecting to. Once the URL held a raw IP, Chromium
        sent the IP as SNI (or none at all) instead of the original
        hostname, and validated the server's certificate against the
        IP rather than the DNS name. Every SNI-vhosted or
        certificate-bound HTTPS target — i.e. nearly the entire modern
        web — would fail to load with a certificate/handshake error.
        Host headers only affect HTTP-layer routing; they cannot
        retroactively change what TLS believes it is connecting to.

        The corrected fix moves IP pinning to the ONLY layer that can
        do it without touching SNI: the Chromium **process launch
        arguments**. ``--host-resolver-rules="MAP host ip"`` tells
        Chromium's own resolver to substitute ``ip`` for ``host``
        internally — Chromium still believes (and tells the TLS
        stack, via SNI, and the cert-validation logic) that it is
        connecting to ``host``; only the underlying socket target
        changes. See :func:`build_host_resolver_rules_args` and
        :func:`resolve_host_for_pinning`, which the Playwright-launching
        call sites now use to build ``args=[...]`` for
        ``chromium.launch()`` *before* creating a context.

        Because ``--host-resolver-rules`` is fixed at browser-launch
        time, it can only cover hostnames known in advance (the target
        URL's host, and any explicitly-added auth/redirect hosts). The
        route/route_web_socket handlers below remain installed as a
        **second, independent layer**: they still resolve and reject
        (``route.abort("accessdenied")``) any request to a blocked
        internal network, covering hosts discovered only at runtime
        (redirects, cross-origin subresources, WebSocket targets) that
        the launch-time pinning could not have known about. For those
        runtime-discovered hosts, the handlers now intentionally do
        **not** rewrite the URL — they only block-or-allow — so a
        residual DNS-rebinding TOCTOU window remains for hosts outside
        the pinned set. This is a deliberate, documented trade-off:
        it fully closes the rebinding race for the primary target (the
        common case, and the one Playwright is actually asked to
        navigate to) while preserving HTTPS functionality everywhere,
        at the cost of a narrower residual race against a fully
        adversarial DNS server for secondary/unplanned hosts.

        """Playwright WebSocket route handler: block-or-allow, no URL rewrite.

        V6 Ready-For-Kali P0 FIX (CISO audit — WebSocket guard never
        installed): the previous implementation was written against
        the JS/TS API shape (``context.routeWebSocket``, camelCase,
        never present on Python's ``BrowserContext``) and against the
        HTTP ``Route`` contract (a two-argument ``(route, request)``
        callback using ``.abort()``/``.continue_()``, neither of
        which exists on ``WebSocketRoute``). Verified empirically
        against the installed ``playwright`` package:
        ``hasattr(BrowserContext, "routeWebSocket")`` is ``False``
        (only ``route_web_socket``, snake_case, exists), and
        ``WebSocketRoute`` exposes ``close()`` / ``connect_to_server()``
        / ``on_message()`` / ``send()`` / ``url`` — no ``abort()`` or
        ``continue_()``. Both mistakes meant registration always threw
        ``AttributeError``, was silently swallowed below, and the
        WebSocket SSRF bypass identified in an earlier round was never
        actually mitigated.

        The real ``route_web_socket`` callback receives a SINGLE
        ``WebSocketRoute`` argument. Playwright does not open a real
        network connection for a WebSocket unless the handler calls
        ``ws.connect_to_server()`` — so blocking is simply "don't call
        it" (plus an explicit page-side close so the page's JS sees an
        immediate, unambiguous failure rather than a socket that hangs
        open and never receives anything). We do not rewrite the
        connection target for the same SNI-safety reason the HTTP
        handler no longer does (``wss://`` connections are also TLS
        handshakes).
