V7 Sprint 2.7 — Request-Rate Governor for concurrent-request test code.

Provides a hard cap on simultaneous in-flight requests per target and
an automatic abort-and-backoff if the target's error rate crosses a
threshold mid-burst. This protects against accidentally DoS-ing a
real bug-bounty target, which is a program-rules violation, not just
bad practice.

Per Principle 1 (deterministic gates over LLM judgment): the cap and
the abort threshold are plain Python ``if`` statements. The LLM never
decides whether to back off — the governor does.

Per Principle 2 (fail-closed, not fail-open): if the governor itself
errors (lock contention, counter overflow), it defaults to ABORT
(stop the burst) rather than proceeding unchecked.

Usage::

    from webpent.shared.rate_governor import RequestRateGovernor

    governor = RequestRateGovernor(
        max_concurrent=20,
        error_rate_threshold=0.3,  # abort if 30% of responses are 5xx
    )

    # Inside a concurrent burst:
    with governor.acquire(target_host) as permit:
        if permit.aborted:
            logger.warning("Burst aborted: %s", permit.reason)
            break
        response = make_request(...)
        permit.record_response(response.status_code)

    Enforces two safety controls on concurrent-request test code
    (e.g., race-condition testing, IDOR enumeration):

      1. **Hard cap on simultaneous in-flight requests per target**
         (config default: 20). Prevents a single burst from
         overwhelming a real bug-bounty target.

      2. **Automatic abort-and-backoff on error-rate threshold**
         (config default: 30% of responses are 5xx). If the target
         starts erroring mid-burst, the governor aborts the remaining
         requests to avoid DoS-ing the target (a program-rules
         violation).

    Thread-safe via a single ``threading.Lock`` guarding all state.
    The lock is held briefly (microseconds) for each acquire/release,
    so contention is negligible even at the 20-concurrent-request cap.
