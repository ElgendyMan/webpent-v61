V5 Sprint 6 — Stealth mode helpers (jitter + rate limiting).

When ``stealth_mode`` is enabled in the LangGraph state, the framework
needs to slow down its request pace to evade naive WAF / IDS rules that
flag bursty, machine-paced traffic. This module centralises:

  * :func:`apply_jitter` — synchronous random sleep used by tool wrappers
    (Nuclei, Dalfox, etc.) and the validator's OOB probes.
  * :func:`async_apply_jitter` — ``asyncio.sleep``-based variant for
    async code paths (FastAPI handlers, async graph nodes). Using
    ``time.sleep`` in an async context would block the event loop and
    stall every concurrent request — a serious regression.
  * :func:`enforce_min_interval` — per-host rate limiter that ensures
    successive requests to the same hostname are separated by at least
    ``stealth_min_request_interval`` seconds, regardless of the drawn
    jitter value.

All functions are NO-OPs when ``stealth_mode`` is False, so callers can
invoke them unconditionally without checking the flag.

Design notes:
  * The module reads ``Settings`` lazily via :func:`get_settings` so
    runtime env overrides are honoured even if the helpers are called
    before the settings singleton is fully initialised.
  * Per-host last-request timestamps are stored in a module-level dict
    keyed by hostname. This is intentionally simple — the framework runs
    one engagement per process, so cross-engagement isolation is not a
    concern. A lock guards the dict to stay safe under Celery workers.
