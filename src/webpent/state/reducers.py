    ``auth_state["cookies"]`` is a list-of-dict (Playwright shape:
    ``{"name", "value", "domain"}``) that needs upsert-by-name
    semantics: a mid-scan reauth (see
    ``agents.validator.agent._validate_with_tool``) replaces the
    value for an EXISTING cookie name, it doesn't add a second entry
    for it.

    Plain :func:`merge_dicts` cannot express this — its "both values
    are lists" branch concatenates, which is the correct behaviour for
    other dict fields (``crawled_data``, ``mental_model``'s edge
    lists) but wrong here. Before this reducer existed, a reauth that
    refreshed ``auth_state["cookies"]`` and returned it would have had
    the fresh entry concatenated onto the stale one from auth_node's
    original write — leaving BOTH the dead and fresh ``PHPSESSID`` in
    the list, with ``execution_sandbox``'s ``_inject_cookies`` sending
    whichever happened to land last in Playwright's own last-write-
    wins cookie application, not necessarily the fresh one.

    This mirrors :func:`merge_hypotheses`'s upsert-by-id pattern:
    existing cookie names keep their position; a new entry with the
    same name replaces the value in place; brand-new names are
    appended. Every other key falls through to normal
    :func:`merge_dicts` behaviour unchanged.
