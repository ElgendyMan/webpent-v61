"""webpent.tools.recon.katana

Wrapper around ProjectDiscovery's ``katana`` CLI for deep crawling.

Katana is a high-performance crawler that recursively discovers
endpoints, links, and JavaScript-rendered routes. Unlike the previous
BeautifulSoup-based single-page crawler, katana follows links to a
configurable depth and emits structured JSONL output.

The wrapper executes::

    katana -u <url> -jc -silent -d 3

where:
  * ``-u <url>``     — target URL
  * ``-jc``          — JSON output with crawl data (request + response meta)
  * ``-silent``      — suppress banner / progress output
  * ``-d 3``         — maximum crawl depth of 3 hops

Each JSONL line represents a discovered endpoint. The wrapper extracts
the endpoint URL from either ``request.endpoint`` (preferred) or the
top-level ``url`` field, and returns a de-duplicated list.
