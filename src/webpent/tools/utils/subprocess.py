# src/webpent/tools/utils/subprocess.py
"""webpent.tools.utils.subprocess

Thin, opinionated wrapper around :mod:`subprocess` used by every tool
wrapper in the framework.

Design goals:
  * Fail loudly with framework-specific exceptions (``ToolNotFoundError``
    vs ``ToolExecutionError``) so callers can distinguish *missing
    binary* from *broken execution*.
  * Always capture stdout and stderr as text (UTF-8, errors replaced)
    so they survive even when the underlying tool emits garbled bytes —
    UNLESS ``binary_output=True`` is requested, in which case raw bytes
    are returned without decoding (V5 Sprint 8: required for ysoserial
    whose serialized Java payloads are NOT valid UTF-8 and would be
    corrupted by ``errors="replace"``).
  * Enforce a timeout to prevent hung scans from blocking the graph.
  * Run each child in a new POSIX session (``start_new_session=True``)
    so that timeout-triggered ``SIGKILL`` propagates to the entire
    process group, including grandchildren spawned by tools such as
    ``nuclei`` or ``nmap``. This prevents orphan/zombie accumulation
    on long engagements.
  * Catch :class:`OSError` (and subclasses such as
    :class:`PermissionError`) so that race conditions between the
    ``shutil.which`` check and the actual ``exec`` — or OS-level
    failures like EMFILE — surface as clean :class:`ToolExecutionError`
    instances rather than raw tracebacks.

V6 Absolute-Flawless P0 FIX (CISO + Red Team audit — Command Injection):
    The previous implementation accepted a ``cmd`` list and forwarded
    it to :func:`subprocess.run` without explicitly setting
    ``shell=False``. While :mod:`subprocess` defaults to ``shell=False``
    when ``cmd`` is a list, omitting the explicit keyword made the
    security posture implicit and brittle — a future refactor that
    accidentally passed a single string (e.g. ``cmd = " ".join(parts)``)
    would silently flip to ``shell=True`` semantics and allow shell
    metacharacter injection from attacker-controlled target URLs.

    This wrapper now:
      1. **Type-rejects** any ``cmd`` that is not a ``list[str]`` — a
         ``str`` argument raises ``TypeError`` immediately so the bug
         surfaces at the caller rather than being silently re-interpreted
         as a shell command.
      2. **Validates** that every element of ``cmd`` is a ``str`` —
         bytes, None, and other types are rejected so an accidental
         ``None`` placeholder can never become the literal string
         ``"None"`` inside a shell token.
      3. **Explicitly passes ``shell=False``** to :func:`subprocess.run`
         in both the text and binary paths. Even though this is the
         default, the explicit keyword documents the security
         contract and protects against any future ``subprocess``
         release that changes the default.
      4. Provides a :func:`quote_for_logging` helper that uses
         :func:`shlex.quote` ONLY for assembling a human-readable
         log line — never for constructing the actual command. This
         satisfies the "use shlex.quote only if string construction
         is unavoidable" CISO directive: the only place we construct
         a string is for diagnostic logging, where injection is a
         non-issue.
