"""tests/test_v9_fix2_path_promotion.py — V9 P0 Fix 2 regression tests.

Covers the two things the hostile audit found broken:

1. ``_classify_by_url_path`` — correctness on the operator's URL table,
   plus the narrowed "fi" pattern (V9 P0 Fix 2-C) so it no longer
   false-positives on paths that merely contain "fi" as a substring
   (config.php, profile.php, notification.php, ...).

2. The promotion gate — ``recommend_action`` must PROMOTE a
   deterministic path-classified hypothesis even though its score
   (~0.28-0.42 under current Mental Model / cost defaults) never
   clears the probabilistic ``PROMOTION_THRESHOLD`` of 0.5. This is
   the actual regression: Fix 2's classifier worked from day one, but
   without this bypass the resulting hypothesis was silently DEFERRED
   forever and sqlmap/dalfox never ran.
